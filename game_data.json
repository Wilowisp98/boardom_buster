[{"game_name":"Federation & Empire","description":"This sprawling empire game is set in the Star Fleet Universe. Players command one or more races in a variety of scenarios as they replay the historical situations in the galactic politics of the future. It is the base set for the Federation and Empire series of products. The Star Fleet Universe series is based on the game Star Fleet Battles, and Federation  Empire is a strategic game based in that background. Federation  Empire is a stand alone game, and Star Fleet Battles is not required or needed to play this game. The two games are closely related, and Star Fleet Battles can be used to resolve some or all of the tactical battles of Federation  Empire, and Federation  Empire can be used as a campaign system for Star Fleet Battles. The original version came out in 1986, and was published by Task Force Games. This was followed in 1990 with the Deluxe version, which replaced the original release. Deluxe was indicated on the front of the box to indicate it was the new version. The Deluxe version included a revised rule book, more counter sheets, and other player aids such as the battle board and player folio. The Deluxe version had three expansions: Federation  Empire: Carrier War Federation  Empire: F  E Module 1 â€“ Special Operations Federation  Empire: F  E Module 2 â€“ Marine Assault In 2000, another revision of the rules was completed, and the FE 2K (as it is called) version stood for a decade. In 2010 the countersheets were entirely redone (with a larger number of counters per sheet) and the rulebook was once again revised to incorporate the last 10 years of errata and rulings, allowing a better integration with the expansions that were released during this period. Expanded by: Federation  Empire: Advanced Operations Federation  Empire: Combined Operations (combined and replaced Federation  Empire: F  E Module 1 â€“ Special Operations and Federation  Empire: F  E Module 2 â€“ Marine Assault) Federation  Empire: Fighter Operations (replaced Federation  Empire: Carrier War) Federation  Empire: Planetary Operations Federation  Empire: Strategic Operations Federation  Empire: ISC War Federation  Empire: Minor Empires Since 2010 ADB has created, in both print and pdf form, Compendium I, II and III. The first two covered the FE sections in Captains Log’s 2140. All material for the base game from these is in the 2010 rule book however material for the expansions Advanced, Combined, Planetary and Strategic Operations are in the first two Compendiums’. Compendium III has Captains Log’s 4150 which were all printed post 2010 rules. Fighter Operations is now updated to the 2010 standard. All relevant items from the first two Compendiums' is included.","subcategory_1":"wargames","subcategory_2":null,"recommended_num_players":4,"suggested_play_age":16,"categories":["Science Fiction","Wargame"],"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Hexagon Grid","Movement Points","Simulation"],"playing_time":300,"language_dependence_description":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","game_rank":7488,"avg_rating":6.42834,"num_rates":427,"rank_subcategory_1":1330,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":4.4032,"num_weights":62,"owned_by":1252,"wished_by":125,"popularity_score":0.15048395940274545,"tag_strategygames":null,"tag_familygames":null,"tag_wargames":1,"tag_thematic":null,"age_group":"Teen","age_group_encoded":3,"playing_time_group":"Very Long","playing_time_group_encoded":4},{"game_name":"Dragon Masters","description":"This odd little game put out by Games Workshop Ltd. uses some of the components of their Mighty Empires strategy game.

The board has one column for each possible total of two sixsided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5  11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6  10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7  9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn’t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn’s progress lost. A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paperandpencil game.","subcategory_1":"familygames","subcategory_2":null,"recommended_num_players":2,"suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["Dice"],"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Push Your Luck","Race"],"playing_time":30,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":764,"avg_rating":6.92486,"num_rates":19638,"rank_subcategory_1":223,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":1.1449,"num_weights":1070,"owned_by":19567,"wished_by":2689,"popularity_score":0.5889255655914455,"tag_strategygames":null,"tag_familygames":1,"tag_wargames":null,"tag_thematic":null,"age_group":"Kids","age_group_encoded":1,"playing_time_group":"Short","playing_time_group_encoded":1},{"game_name":"Tigris & Euphrates","description":"Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris  Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts. Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris  Euphrates included a doublesided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This ziggurat expansion, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn. Some versions of Tigris  Euphrates are listed as being for 24 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 34 players. Tigris  Euphrates is part of what is sometimes called Reiner Knizia's tilelaying trilogy.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":null,"recommended_num_players":3,"suggested_play_age":12,"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Ancient","Civilization","Territory Building"],"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Connections","Hand Management","Hidden Victory Points","Highest-Lowest Scoring","Income","Set Collection","Square Grid","Take That","Tile Placement"],"playing_time":120,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":122,"avg_rating":7.70178,"num_rates":29125,"rank_subcategory_1":102,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":3.4968,"num_weights":2796,"owned_by":31740,"wished_by":7796,"popularity_score":0.9540356000000001,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":null,"tag_wargames":null,"tag_thematic":null,"age_group":"Family","age_group_encoded":2,"playing_time_group":"Long","playing_time_group_encoded":3},{"game_name":"Airlines","description":"Airlines' theme is exactly as suggested by the title. The game is similar to the Sid Sackson classic, Acquire, in that players are competing to become majority stockholders in several highlyabstracted companies with the player owning the most valuable portfolio at the end being the winner. Each turn, a player chooses from one of two actions: expand an airline and put stock into his hand, or play stock from his hand. Expanding an airline adds to its route(s) on the board and increases its value but the trick is that when a scoring card shows up (randomly), only played stock counts as a player's holdings.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":null,"recommended_num_players":6,"suggested_play_age":12,"categories":["Aviation / Flight","Economic"],"mechanics":["Investment","Network and Route Building","Stock Holding"],"playing_time":90,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":6751,"avg_rating":6.57488,"num_rates":382,"rank_subcategory_1":2169,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":2.4242,"num_weights":33,"owned_by":511,"wished_by":73,"popularity_score":0.14243335479125013,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":null,"tag_wargames":null,"tag_thematic":null,"age_group":"Family","age_group_encoded":2,"playing_time_group":"Long","playing_time_group_encoded":3},{"game_name":"David & Goliath","description":"This game adds a very interesting twist to the standard tricktaking genre.
