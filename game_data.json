[{"game_name":"Die Macher","description":"Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some mediacontrol victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game. The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 34 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the reunited Germany and updated several features of the rules as well. The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter fiveround variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.","publication_year":1986,"min_players":3,"max_players":5,"best_num_players":5,"recommended_num_players":4,"suggested_play_age":14,"categories":["Economic","Negotiation","Political"],"mechanics":["Alliances","Area Majority / Influence","Auction / Bidding","Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"families":["Country: Germany","Digital Implementations: VASSAL","Political: Elections","Series: Classic Line (Valley Games)"],"designers":["Karl-Heinz Schmiel"],"artists":["Bernd Brunnhofer","Marcus Gschwendtner","Harald Lieske"],"publishers":["Hans im Glück","Moskito Spiele","Ediciones MasQueOca","Portal Games","Spielworxx","sternenschimmermeer","Stronghold Games","Valley Games, Inc.","YOKA Games"],"playing_time":240,"min_playtime":240,"max_playtime":240,"min_age":14,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text"},{"game_name":"Dragonmaster","description":"Dragonmaster is a tricktaking card game based on an older game called Coup d'Ã‰tat. Each player is given a supply of plastic gems, which represent points. Each player will get to be the dealer for five different hands, with slightly different goals for each hand. After all cards have been dealt out, the dealer decides which hand best suits his or her current cards, and the other players are penalized points (in the form of crystals) for taking certain tricks or cards. For instance, if first or last is called, then a player is penalized for taking the first or last tricks. All players will get a chance to be dealer for five hands, but other players can steal this opportunity by taking all of the tricks during certain hands. At the end, the biggest pile of gems wins the game.

Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha figures scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions — or all three at once! Players can make lightningquick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each figure (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group. Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four figures have been removed from play due to a tie for influence. At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types. Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, nonmajority symbols each player has collected. The game is part of what is sometimes called the Knizia tilelaying trilogy.","publication_year":1998,"min_players":2,"max_players":4,"best_num_players":3,"recommended_num_players":2,"suggested_play_age":10,"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Medieval"],"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Hand Management","Hexagon Grid","Once-Per-Game Abilities","Set Collection","Tile Placement"],"families":["Components: Map (Continental / National scale)","Components: Player Screens","Country: Japan","Series: Euro Classics (Reiner Knizia)","Series: Tile-Laying Trilogy (Reiner Knizia)","Theme: Samurai"],"designers":["Reiner Knizia"],"artists":["Franz Vohwinkel","徐昀享 (Xu Yunxiang)","李小娜 (LI Xiaona)","杨静雯 (Yang Jingwen)","谢有鑫 (Xie Youxin)","郭紫颖 (Guo Ziying)","陈杰 (Chen Jie)"],"publishers":["Fantasy Flight Games","Hans im Glück","999 Games","ABACUSSPIELE","Astrel Games","Ceilikan Jogos","Descartes Editeur","Edge Entertainment","Galakta","Hobby Japan","Korea Boardgames","Lacerta","Lautapelit.fi","Lighthouse Games","Rio Grande Games","Skandinavisk  Spil Kompagni","Smart Ltd","Wargames Club Publishing","Yaofish Games"],"playing_time":60,"min_playtime":30,"max_playtime":60,"min_age":10,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text"},{"game_name":"Tal der Könige","description":"When you see the triangular box and the luxurious, large blocks of Tal der Könige (German: Valley of the Kings), you can tell this game was designed to be beautiful as well as functional. The object of the game is to build pyramids out of the different colored blocks. A pyramid scores more points when it's made from a few colors, but it's much harder to consistently outbid the other players for the necessary blocks. The game is over when the Pharoah's Pyramid in the center is completed, which is built using all the blocks that the players don't use during the course of the game.

As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains. All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2for1 for shares of the newer, larger business. The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth. History of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of Vacations from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called ACQUIRE. 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had developed some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.

Lloyd Solon's Rules help players to correct poor strategy during the beginning of the game that can been seen with new and unexperienced players (running out of money soon is the main mistake that must be omitted!). 2008 Dated 2008 cardboard edition with chipboard board tiles, redesigned stocks money 2016 Dated 2016 The current affordable massmarket edition. It looks at first sight to be similar to previous modern editions, but has been criticised for the use of inferior design choices such as hardtoread greyongrey embossed slots and the unusual tile fonts. It contains modified rules and a slightly smaller playing grid. Although these changes have been criticised for not ultimately improving upon Sackson's original design, they are generally regarded as not being too damaging to it. 2023 Renegade Game Studio partners with Hasbro, and releases their new version, with Classic Mode or Tycoon Mode — play with or without tertiary stockholder merger bonus. 2024 The Renegade 60th Anniversary edition includes a set of plastic weighted poker chips, and Special Powers Variant cards.","publication_year":1964,"min_players":2,"max_players":6,"best_num_players":4,"recommended_num_players":3,"suggested_play_age":12,"categories":["Economic","Territory Building"],"mechanics":["Hand Management","Investment","Market","Square Grid","Stock Holding","Tile Placement","Victory Points as a Resource"],"families":["Components: 9 x 12 Grids","Digital Implementations: TableTop Simulator Mod (TTS)","Digital Implementations: VASSAL","Misc: BGG Hall of Fame","Misc: Dice Tower Hall of Fame","Series: 3M Bookshelf Series"],"designers":["Sid Sackson"],"artists":["Eric Hibbeler","Scott O'Gara","Scott Okumura","Anita Osburn","Peter Whitley"],"publishers":["3M","The Avalon Hill Game Co","Arclight Games","Avalon Hill","Banana Games","Dujardin","Grow Jogos e Brinquedos","Korea Boardgames","PS-Games","Renegade Game Studios","Schmidt France","Schmidt International","Schmidt Spiele","Selecta Spel en Hobby","Smart Games, Inc.","Yayoi The Dreamer"],"playing_time":90,"min_playtime":90,"max_playtime":90,"min_age":12,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text"}]
