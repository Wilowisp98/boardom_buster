[{"game_name":"Die Macher","description":"Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some mediacontrol victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game. The 1986 edition featured four parties from the old West Germany and supported 34 players. The 1997 edition supports up to five players in the reunited Germany and updated several features of the rules as well. The 2006 edition also supports up to five players and adds a shorter fiveround variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":3,"max_players":5,"recommended_num_players":"4","suggested_play_age":14,"categories":["Economic","Negotiation","Political"],"mechanics":["Alliances","Area Majority / Influence","Auction / Bidding","Dice Rolling","Hand Management","Simultaneous Action Selection"],"playing_time":240,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":453,"avg_rating":7.58985,"num_rates":5873,"rank_subcategory_1":262,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":4.3101,"num_weights":790,"owned_by":8287,"wished_by":2187,"popularity_score":0.23130479435720416,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Teen","tag_Teen":1,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Very Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":1,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":0,"is_small_group_game":1,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Dragonmaster","description":"Dragonmaster is a tricktaking card game based on an older game called Coup d'Ã‰tat.

Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha figures scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions — or all three at once! Players can make lightningquick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each figure (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group. Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four figures have been removed from play due to a tie for influence. At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types. Ties are not uncommon and are broken based on the number of other, nonmajority symbols each player has collected.

As the businesses grow with tile placements, they also start merging, giving the majority stockholders of the acquired business sizable bonuses, which can then be used to reinvest into other chains. All of the investors in the acquired company can then cash in their stocks for current value or trade them 2for1 for shares of the newer, larger business. The game is a race to acquire the greatest wealth. History of Acquire: This Sid Sackson classic has taken many different forms over the years depending on the publisher, yet the rules and game play have stayed the same. The 1966 version of the 3M bookshelf edition included rules for a 2player variant. The original version is part of the 3M Bookshelf Series. Many books and websites incorrectly list this as a 1962 publication as the 3M Company used previously copyrighted artwork when they released the game in 1964. 3M actually received the idea for the game of Vacations from Sid Sackson in May of 1963 and decided to take his idea and put it into artwork they had developed the year before for a game called ACQUIRE. 3M's original game idea for a game called ACQUIRE must not have been very good so they decided to take Sid's idea of Vacations and put it into their concept of ACQUIRE. They released some limited test market games in 8 Midwestern U.S. cities in December of 1963 with a box that had a 1963 copyright. These games had Sid's original rules. When 3M released the mass market games in 1964, they had developed some of Sid's original ideas and changed some rules and game play to match their production desires. They released them with outer boxes that were copyrighted 1962 and inner boxes with rules that were dated 1963.

The game is set in the mythical world of the elves. A group of fledgling elves (the players) are charged with visiting as many of the twenty Elfencities as they can over the course of 4 rounds. To accomplish the task they will use various forms of transportation such as Giant Pigs, Elfcarts, Unicorns, Rafts, Magic Clouds, Trollwagons, and Dragons. Gameplay: Players begin in the Elf capitol, draw one face down movement tile, and are dealt eight transport cards and a secret 'home' city card that they must reach at the end of the 4th round or lose points for each city space away from 'home' they are at the end of the game. Markers of each player's color are placed in each city on the board and are collected when the player visits that city (each counts as 1 point). The round proceeds in 2 stages. The first part of the round consists of the drawing of Tiles showing the differing types of transport (except rafts) from a combination of face up and face down tiles (if a player doesn't like the 5 tiles that are face up; they can always draw blind from the face down tiles and hope to get one they need). These transport tiles need to match the Transportation cards in your hand to use them most effectively. After each player has a total of 4 tiles they take turns placing a tile on any one of the roads that run between the elf cities. Only one transport tile may be placed on each road; so players may use other players tiles to travel if they have the matching cards in their hand. This frequently causes a readjustment of planned travel routes as other players tiles can allow you to move farther or shorter than you had first thought. Players can play their tiles to help themselves or hinder others by playing a slow mode of transport on another players (perceived) path. Each mode of transport has certain terrain it can travel through quickly or slowly, and those that it cannot. These are listed on the top of each transportation card by the number terrain symbols. The number of terrain symbols equals how many matching cards you must play to move across a given tile in a given terrain. For example, a Magic Cloud tile placed in a mountain would take one Magic cloud card to travel across (1 mountain symbol on card means Magic clouds are fast in mountains). If the same tile was placed on a road in forest terrain it would require 2 Magic Cloud cards to travel that route (2 Forest symbols on card means Magic Clouds are slow in Forest). Magic Clouds cannot travel in desert terrain at all (no desert symbols on card). All modes of transport are different and Rafts can be used on rivers or lakes without needing tiles. Rafts go slow upstream (2 raft cards needed) and fast downstream (1 card needed). The small lake requires 1 raft card to travel across and the larger lake requires 2 cards to travel across. Players may keep one unused transport counter and up to 4 Transportation cards from one round to the next. The second part of the round begins after all players have finished placing their transportation tiles for the round. Each player plays his cards and moves his elfboot around the board collecting his tokens from the cities visited. If there is a Transport tile on a route and a player has no matching Transportation card he may 'Caravan' across it by playing any 3 Transportation cards from his hand. As a bit of 'take that' each player has a trouble tile which can be placed next to any transportation tile during the first part of the round. This counter means that in order to travel that path an additional card of the transport type must be played or 4 cards to 'Caravan'. Victory: if at the end of round 3 a player has visited all 20 cities he is the winner. If not the game ends after round 4 when 'Home' cities are revealed and each player subtracts points for each city he is away from his 'home' subtracting that from his collected city tokens. The person with the highest score wins.","subcategory_1":"familygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":6,"recommended_num_players":"6","suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["Fantasy","Travel"],"mechanics":["Hand Management","Network and Route Building","Open Drafting","Point to Point Movement"],"playing_time":60,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":1414,"avg_rating":6.67312,"num_rates":9089,"rank_subcategory_1":463,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":2.1517,"num_weights":725,"owned_by":11511,"wished_by":832,"popularity_score":0.18927588681299878,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":1,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Medium","tag_Medium":1,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":1},{"game_name":"Bohnanza","description":"Bohnanza is the first in the Bohnanza family of games and has been published in several different editions, including a 2023 version with flowers. This entry lists a few different major card sets for Bohnanza: the base game for 35 players, the expanded game with the same name for 27 players (that is, first expansion included), and Bohnanza Pocket. In the game, you plant, then harvest bean cards in order to earn coins. Each player starts with a hand of random bean cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of beans in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck — unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game. On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the fields in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of bean, so if you must plant a type of bean that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete — and all trades on a turn must involve the active player — then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand. When you harvest beans, you receive coins based on the number of bean cards in that field and the beanometer for that particular type of bean. Flip over 14 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins. The original German edition supports 35 players. The English version from Rio Grande Games comes with the first edition of the first German expansion included in a slightly oversized box. One difference in the contents, however, is that bean #22's Weinbrandbohne (Brandy Bean) was replaced by the Wachsbohne, or Wax Bean. This edition includes rules for up to seven players, like the ErweiterungsSet, but also adapts the twoplayer rules of Al Cabohne in order to allow two people to play Bohnanza.","subcategory_1":"familygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":7,"recommended_num_players":"3","suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["Card Game","Farming","Negotiation"],"mechanics":["Hand Management","Multi-Use Cards","Negotiation","Set Collection","Trading"],"playing_time":45,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":530,"avg_rating":7.06852,"num_rates":48393,"rank_subcategory_1":154,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":1.6679,"num_weights":3029,"owned_by":76612,"wished_by":3717,"popularity_score":0.4483821396606482,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":1,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Medium","tag_Medium":1,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":1},{"game_name":"Ra","description":"Ra is an auction and setcollection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme.

The game lasts for three epochs (rounds). The game is easy to learn. From the Box: The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour! The players seek to expand their power and fame and there are many ways to accomplish this: Influencing Pharaohs, Building monuments, Farming on the Nile, Paying homage to the Gods, Advancing the technology and culture of the people.

On each turn dice are rolled to determine which resources the island produces. Players build structures by 'spending' resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) which are represented by the relevant resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep. Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each depicting one of the five resourceproducing terrain typesor the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. A number disk, the value of which will correspond to the roll of two 6sided dice, are placed on each terrain tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are placed on intersections and borders of the terrain tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which terrain tiles their lastplaced settlement is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile. A turn consists of rolling the dice, collecting resource cards based on this dice roll and the position of settlements (or upgraded cities—think: hotels), turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, possibly playing a development card, or trading resource cards with other players. If the dice roll is a 7, the active player moves the robber to a new terrain tile and steals a resource card from another player who has a settlement adjacent to that tile. Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road or the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), s/he announces this and claims the win.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":"familygames","min_players":3,"max_players":4,"recommended_num_players":"3","suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["Economic","Negotiation"],"mechanics":["Chaining","Dice Rolling","Hexagon Grid","Income","Modular Board","Negotiation","Network and Route Building","Race","Random Production","Trading","Variable Set-up"],"playing_time":120,"language_dependence_description":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","game_rank":573,"avg_rating":7.09445,"num_rates":132821,"rank_subcategory_1":532,"rank_subcategory_2":197,"avg_weight":2.2879,"num_weights":8306,"owned_by":219314,"wished_by":7397,"popularity_score":0.9297731757683515,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":1,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":1,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":0,"is_small_group_game":1,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Basari","description":"Basari is a game of gem merchants competing in a marketplace: racing, collecting, trading, and predicting what the other merchants will do. To start the game, players receive 12 gemstones (3 each of 4 colors). Each turn there will be a movement phase and an action phase: For movement, everyone simultaneously rolls their die and moves their markers around a track. They then choose one of three different actions to perform. The actions are:  to take a variety of gems from a market stall,  to immediately score from between 4 and 7 points, or  to roll and move again and also collect points. The action cards are revealed simultaneously. If only 1 player chose a particular action, they simply perform that action. If 2 players chose the same action, they barter back and forth with gemstones. One player will eventually accept the other's offer of gems, and the other will take the action. If 3 or 4 players all chose the same action card, that action is cancelled. Note that in 4player games, there will always be a conflict in choice of 3 actions, so much more negotiating goes on. A new turn begins with everyone rolling their die, moving, then choosing and revealing their action cards. When any merchant piece completes a lap around the board, the round ends and bonus points are awarded based on who has the majority in each gem color and who has completed a lap. After three rounds, the game is over and the highest score wins.

They put in hard hours building highspeed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyor belts  but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire. In general, players will first fill all of their robot's registers with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it! Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.

Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads. To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses. When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section. Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing. Wacky, Wacky West remake description: Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Drüber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner. Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair  Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mindmarbling drink the locals call Wacky Water! Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens... Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon..... In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tilesperhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.","subcategory_1":"familygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":4,"recommended_num_players":"3","suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["American West","Bluffing","City Building"],"mechanics":["Tile Placement","Voting"],"playing_time":45,"language_dependence_description":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","game_rank":3964,"avg_rating":6.27602,"num_rates":1973,"rank_subcategory_1":1281,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":1.8193,"num_weights":166,"owned_by":3760,"wished_by":166,"popularity_score":0.13956547151599336,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":1,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Medium","tag_Medium":1,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Full Metal Planète","description":"In this game of science fiction strip mining, players land on a planet and try and grab as much ore as possible and take off before the game is over.

The scene is set in the ruins of a mighty kingdom, now inhabited by sparse groups of natives and swarms of monsters. Beneath it all are the rich remnants of a magical civilization, scattered and lost across the map. To this scene come the adventurers, seekers of riches and fame, to make a name for themselves in this promising field. Swordsman and Dwarf, Magician and Sorceror, the humans and the halfhumans come seeking to loot the legendary riches of a lost civilization. Now you can play the part of one of these adventurers, stepping into an unknown Realm of magic and monsters, battles and treasures. As a player, you will take on the role of one of the sixteen major characters who are represented in detail in the game. You will control where he goes, what he tries to do, how he handles himself in combat, and much more. In the course of the game, you will run into deadly monsters, tribes of humans ranging from old friends to sworn enemies, and treasures that will enhance your abilities in many ways. MAGIC REALM is a complex game designed to recapture the suspense and desperate struggles of fantasy literature. The game creates a small but complete fantasy world, where each game is a new adventure with a new map where everything lies hidden at new locations. The game includes many more playing pieces than are actually used in a single playing. The additional pieces are set up and can appear, depending on the directions in which the characters explore, but many of the treasure troves, treasures, and spells will still be set up, unfound, when the game ends, and many of the monsters and natives might never be met. The result is an extremely unpredictable game full of surprises, a game that plays very differently each time it is played. The complete game system includes hiking, hiding and searching, fatigue, wounds, rest, trade, hiring natives, and combat between characters, monsters, and natives using a variety of weapons on horseback and afoot, as well as many magical effects. Between exploring a new land where the mountains, caves, valleys, and woods change every game, and not knowing what you will find in each place, you will find each game a new and unpredictable adventure, filled with surprises. You will find this like no other board game you have ever played.

The main goal of each citystate is to gain points in the form of technical advances, while keeping their culture's misery level as low as possible. The payout structure is similar to those of Civilization and Advanced Civilization in that more resources of the same type yield increasingly higher payouts. This time particular payouts are triggered by card play for every player at once.

There are uncharted territories to get lost in and tombs and ruins to plunder. And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay siege to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat. Dark Tower was technologically impressive when it was released in 1981. Gameplay was facilitated by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself. Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors. The computer would play brief musical serenades at significant points of the game.","subcategory_1":"thematic","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":1,"max_players":4,"recommended_num_players":"3","suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["Adventure","Electronic","Exploration","Fantasy","Fighting"],"mechanics":["Area Movement","Push Your Luck"],"playing_time":90,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":3372,"avg_rating":6.8835,"num_rates":1410,"rank_subcategory_1":712,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":1.802,"num_weights":101,"owned_by":1945,"wished_by":520,"popularity_score":0.15654860980454985,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":1,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":1,"is_solo_game":1,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Dark World","description":"Along the lines of HeroQuest comes a much more heavily produced game called Dark World.

Federation  Empire is a stand alone game, and Star Fleet Battles is not required or needed to play this game. The two games are closely related, and Star Fleet Battles can be used to resolve some or all of the tactical battles of Federation  Empire, and Federation  Empire can be used as a campaign system for Star Fleet Battles. The original version came out in 1986, and was published by Task Force Games. This was followed in 1990 with the Deluxe version, which replaced the original release. Deluxe was indicated on the front of the box to indicate it was the new version. The Deluxe version included a revised rule book, more counter sheets, and other player aids such as the battle board and player folio. The Deluxe version had three expansions: Federation  Empire: Carrier War Federation  Empire: F  E Module 1 â€“ Special Operations Federation  Empire: F  E Module 2 â€“ Marine Assault In 2000, another revision of the rules was completed, and the FE 2K (as it is called) version stood for a decade. In 2010 the countersheets were entirely redone (with a larger number of counters per sheet) and the rulebook was once again revised to incorporate the last 10 years of errata and rulings, allowing a better integration with the expansions that were released during this period.

The board has one column for each possible total of two sixsided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5  11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6  10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7  9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn’t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn’s progress lost. A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paperandpencil game.","subcategory_1":"familygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":4,"recommended_num_players":"2","suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["Dice"],"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Push Your Luck","Race"],"playing_time":30,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":764,"avg_rating":6.92547,"num_rates":19665,"rank_subcategory_1":224,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":1.1446,"num_weights":1072,"owned_by":19594,"wished_by":2685,"popularity_score":0.2720567064087732,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":1,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Short","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":1,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Tigris & Euphrates","description":"Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris  Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts. Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris  Euphrates included a doublesided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This ziggurat expansion, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn. Some versions of Tigris  Euphrates are listed as being for 24 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 34 players. Tigris  Euphrates is part of what is sometimes called Reiner Knizia's tilelaying trilogy.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":4,"recommended_num_players":"3","suggested_play_age":12,"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Ancient","Civilization","Territory Building"],"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Connections","Hand Management","Hidden Victory Points","Highest-Lowest Scoring","Income","Set Collection","Square Grid","Take That","Tile Placement"],"playing_time":120,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":123,"avg_rating":7.70189,"num_rates":29141,"rank_subcategory_1":102,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":3.4962,"num_weights":2797,"owned_by":31748,"wished_by":7792,"popularity_score":0.45373929731728907,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":1,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Airlines","description":"Airlines' theme is exactly as suggested by the title.

After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up.

The game originally consisted of a single deck of cards of rank 2–10 in five different colors with three special handshakes (HS in scoring examples below) in each suit, but as of 2019 the game now includes six colored suits, with the sixth color being optional for gameplay. A game board is included to organize discarded cards and help players organize their card collections. The object of the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the colored suits of cards. On a player's turn, they must first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the colorappropriate discard pile, then draw one card, either from the deck or from the top of a discard pile. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order, but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3. The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the deck. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total; one handshake doubles an expedition's value, while two handshakes triples that value and three handshakes quadruple it. Expeditions start at a value of 20, so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least eight cards played into it. A complete game of Lost Cities lasts three matches, with scores for each match being added together. Scoring example 1: An expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 plus the initial 20. Scoring example 2: An expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, plus the initial 20, ×3 for the two multipliers, plus the 20pt bonus for playing 8+ cards. Scoring example 3: An expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth 6 total points: 17 plus the initial 20, ×2 for the multiplier.","subcategory_1":"familygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":2,"recommended_num_players":"2","suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["Card Game","Exploration","Math"],"mechanics":["Hand Management","Melding and Splaying","Ordering","Push Your Luck","Score-and-Reset Game","Set Collection"],"playing_time":30,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":337,"avg_rating":7.24736,"num_rates":48169,"rank_subcategory_1":80,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":1.4763,"num_weights":3185,"owned_by":70905,"wished_by":6341,"popularity_score":0.5078625566696492,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":1,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Short","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":1,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Ricochet Robots","description":"Ricochet Robots is less of a game and more of a puzzle, which explains why there's such an odd number of solutions possible.

It's a multiplayer wargame with a carddriven combat system and a political layer that players must contend with. For just over one hundred years England and France battled over who would sit on the French throne. Even within France itself factions developed, putting forth their own candidates challenging the rights of the Dauphin. From this struggle heroes emerged, notably the Black Prince and Jeanne d'Arc, The Maid of Orleans. Tremendous battles were fought at Crecy, Poitiers and Agincourt, yet their impact on the war was ephemeral. Long sieges followed short campaigns, bands of the notorious Free Companies, temporarily unemployed, marauded across the countryside in search of rapine and plunder. Complicating matters, both famine and plague poisoned the seasons. All in all, 'twas a grand time! The game randomly lasts from 8 to 10 turns. The winner is the player with the most Pretender Points. Points are gained at the end of each turn for each Province a player controls. Controlled cities gain revenue. Those can be spent on Battle Cards and fortification. Battles are resolved by playing Battle Cards (yellow(numerical) or red(special cards), combined with Influence, fortifications, and die roll.

This is, in the ideal, a 4 player game. Each turn a card is revealed that displays 3 actions that players can choose from. Each player in turn choose an action by playing a 1, 2 or 3 card identifying the first, second or third action on the revealed card. The beauty of this mechanism lies in the distribution of 3 actions among 4 players. Someone always misses out. If two players choose the same action (and this is often, decided by the last player as the first 3 often  not always  but often choose actions a1, 2 and 3) the players who chose it negotiate a solution. If they cannot come to an agreement they duel. This is one of the defining elements of the game, but can take some time (negotiations can) and so was dropped from the reimplementation as Domaine. The game board is built of 6 tiles randomly placed in a frame producing a slightly different game each time. It is seen by many as the third in a Teuber thematic trilogy defined by Entdecker, CATAN, LÃ¶wenherz. The board is conflicted and in the manner of Go the idea is to capture as much territory as possible. Each player starts with three castles (12 across all four players, and a crowded board). They build walls to create kingdoms, and train knights to defend them, both key actions on that action card they bid on each turn. Consequently this is a high conflict area grabbing game with a heavy element of negotiation.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":4,"recommended_num_players":"3","suggested_play_age":12,"categories":["Medieval","Political"],"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Auction / Bidding","Enclosure","Modular Board","Negotiation","Square Grid"],"playing_time":90,"language_dependence_description":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","game_rank":1616,"avg_rating":7.05176,"num_rates":2674,"rank_subcategory_1":854,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":2.7836,"num_weights":305,"owned_by":3978,"wished_by":379,"popularity_score":0.16194364174641357,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":1,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Conquest","description":"Conquest was designed to be a diceless wargame.

Often the Sandwich Move can completely turn the game around and give you a dazzling win. 1999 Mensa Select","subcategory_1":"abstracts","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":2,"recommended_num_players":"2+","suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["Abstract Strategy"],"mechanics":["Hexagon Grid","Pattern Building"],"playing_time":20,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":16687,"avg_rating":6.746,"num_rates":50,"rank_subcategory_1":769,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":2.4,"num_weights":5,"owned_by":116,"wished_by":44,"popularity_score":0.13632446033523374,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":1,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Short","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":1,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Big City","description":"This game, with its really wonderful plastic bits, is about building a city.

It covers the development of ancient civilizations from the invention of agriculture c. 8000 B.C. to the emergence of Rome around the middle of the third century B.C. Each player leads a nation of peoples over a map board of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture. Although battles and territorial strategy are important, this is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest. Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, and political factors so that such conflicts that do arise are a result of rivalry and land shortage rather than a desire to eliminate other players. Nomad and farmer, warrior and merchant, artisan and citizen all have an essential part to play in the development of civilization. It is the player who most effectively changes emphasis between these various outlooks who will achieve the best balance and win. (from the Introduction to the Avalon Hill edition rulebook) This game has a huge following and is widely regarded as one of the best games about ancient civilizations. Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians. Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law. The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements. Civilization is widely thought to be the first game ever to incorporate a technology tree, allowing players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items were obtained. This influential mechanism has been adopted by countless other board games, card games, and computer games.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":7,"recommended_num_players":"4","suggested_play_age":12,"categories":["Ancient","Civilization","Economic","Negotiation"],"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Hand Management","Set Collection","Tech Trees / Tech Tracks","Trading","Turn Order: Stat-Based"],"playing_time":360,"language_dependence_description":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","game_rank":471,"avg_rating":7.49401,"num_rates":7599,"rank_subcategory_1":330,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":3.643,"num_weights":762,"owned_by":11280,"wished_by":1017,"popularity_score":0.2077277613640651,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Very Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":1,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":1},{"game_name":"Verräter","description":"This board game masquerading as a card game is about a conflict between two factions, the Rose and the Eagle.

This accomplishes two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a fog of war because your opponent cannot tell, save through good memory or deduction, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength. Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number. Although most war games have some type of mechanism that allows units to take losses in steps of their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides. Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks, Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.","subcategory_1":"wargames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":2,"recommended_num_players":"1","suggested_play_age":12,"categories":["Wargame","World War II"],"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Hexagon Grid","Secret Unit Deployment","Simulation"],"playing_time":240,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":2997,"avg_rating":7.67425,"num_rates":692,"rank_subcategory_1":149,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":3.6,"num_weights":90,"owned_by":1170,"wished_by":138,"popularity_score":0.1601661376091057,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":1,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Very Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":1,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"WestFront: The War in Europe, 1943-45","description":"WestFront details the conflict between the Allies and Germany during WWII between 194345.

In this game, as in the desert campaign, the events of the battlefield are often subordinate to the battle of wits and nerves between opposing commanders. A good grasp of strategy will help, but foresight, nerve, and instinct are the crucial elements of success. CONTENTS 100 wooden blocks (20mm) Labels Mapboard (11 x 34 inches) Rules 1.02 42 Supply Cards 4 Dice (adapted from Columbia Games website) Rommel in the Desert is a preFront game touching on the conflict between the British and Germans in North Africa during WWII. A game of maneuver, each side has to move with precision and know when to strike, since a cut in supply spells disaster for either side. The supply system is card driven. The game comes with a map of North Africa and 100 wooden blocks to represent the British and Germans. This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games nonetheless all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a fog of war because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and its current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.

In over four years of titanic struggle, the ancient Europe of Kings and Emperors tore itself to pieces, giving birth to our own violent modern age. The bloody battles fought in the trenches of the Western Front, the icy plains of Poland, the mountains of the Balkans, and the deserts of Arabia, shaped the world we know today. We are all orphans of the Great War. Paths of Glory: The First World War, designed by sixtime Charles S. Roberts awards winner, Ted Raicer, allows players to step into the shoes of the monarchs and marshals who triumphed and bungled from 1914 to 1918. As the Central Powers you must use the advantage of interior lines and the fighting skill of the Imperial German Army to win your rightful 'place in the sun.' As the Entente Powers (Allies) you must bring your greater numbers to bear to put an end to German militarism and ensure this is the war 'to end all wars.' Both players will find their generalship and strategic abilities put to the test as Paths of Glory's innovative game systems let you recreate all the dramatic events of World War I.

The game covers WWI from its outbreak to American intervention and spans all of Europe and the Middle East. Not only is the game innovative, but it also plays fast, usually within just an evening. While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play. Players are given a hand of cards to play out six subphases of a turn. Each subphase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units. Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points. The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time. How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.","subcategory_1":"wargames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":2,"recommended_num_players":"1","suggested_play_age":14,"categories":["Wargame","World War I"],"mechanics":["Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Dice Rolling","Point to Point Movement"],"playing_time":480,"language_dependence_description":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","game_rank":248,"avg_rating":8.07278,"num_rates":5366,"rank_subcategory_1":3,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":3.8509,"num_weights":691,"owned_by":10715,"wished_by":2423,"popularity_score":0.2506227267198887,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":1,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Teen","tag_Teen":1,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Very Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":1,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"El Grande","description":"In this awardwinning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain. The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner. In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply). A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo  a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round. The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had there into the region you secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Twopoint bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande and in the region containing the king.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":5,"recommended_num_players":"4","suggested_play_age":12,"categories":["Medieval","Renaissance"],"mechanics":["Action Drafting","Area Majority / Influence","Area Movement","Auction / Bidding","Hand Management","Memory","Open Drafting","Selection Order Bid","Simultaneous Action Selection","Take That","Turn Order: Auction"],"playing_time":120,"language_dependence_description":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","game_rank":92,"avg_rating":7.76203,"num_rates":30493,"rank_subcategory_1":82,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":2.9468,"num_weights":2405,"owned_by":31779,"wished_by":7229,"popularity_score":0.44273423130352973,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":1,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Union Pacific","description":"Union Pacific is a trainthemed stock market game.

It is a light tactical war game during the age of sail where two ships face off against one another on the sea. There are basically two layers to the game, the broadsides portion in which players plot their movement with a deck of cards, attempting to maneuver their ships in such a way that they can fire a volley of cannon balls at the opponent while minimizing the risk of return fire. The second layer of the game begins when the movement of ships results in them bumping into one another. In these instances the Boarding Parties portion comes into play. Here players line up their ships next to one another and attempt to storm the other ship and kill the opposing captain. Players can only move a limited amount of their units each turn and so some planning is required to hem in the opposing captain. The components for the game are quite elaborate. Each player is given a fully detailed plastic ship about a foot long with removable masts. Also, each player is given a whole crew of little plastic pirate figures, cannon, and captain. Lastly the board is full color and styled in the period. Note that the first edition was published in 1982 by Larry Harris, Jr. (Citadel Game Systems) and came in a box similar in size to the Games Workshop Ltd. or The Avalon Hill Game Co games. There are no elaborate plastic ships, cannons or playing pieces in the original edition, though. You get paper maps and cardboard counters.","subcategory_1":"thematic","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":2,"recommended_num_players":null,"suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["Nautical","Pirates","Wargame"],"mechanics":["Action Queue","Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Hand Management","Point to Point Movement","Square Grid"],"playing_time":60,"language_dependence_description":null,"game_rank":7562,"avg_rating":6.21791,"num_rates":604,"rank_subcategory_1":1189,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":1.8333,"num_weights":48,"owned_by":1142,"wished_by":360,"popularity_score":0.13649457138900498,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":1,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Medium","tag_Medium":1,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Conquest of the Empire","description":"Conquest of the Empire is part of Milton Bradley's Gamemaster series. It is set during the Roman Empire and depicts the struggle around the Mediterranean as rival factions attempt to take control of the empire. Each player plays one of these factions and receives a Caesar figure, several general figures, and ships of a specific color. Along with these leaders, players utilize a pool of generic units composed of infantry, cavalry, and catapults. All game pieces are plastic figures. Players attempt to conquer their neighbors and build up cities and fortifications to increase production of wealth. Players also may build road networks that allow for faster movement, by all armies. Along the way players have to contend with rising inflation which makes military units more and more expensive. Eventually through elimination one player pulls ahead for the win.

The Axis which has Germany and Japan, and the Allies which has the USA, the United Kingdom, and the USSR. A full map of the world is provided, broken up in various chunks similar to Risk. The game comes with gobs of plastic miniatures that represent various military units during WWII. Players have at their disposal infantry, armor, fighters, bombers, battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines, troop transports, antiair guns, and factories. All of the units perform differently and many have special functions. Players have to work together with their teammates in order to coordinate offenses and decide how best to utilize their production points. Players also have the option of risking production resources on the possibility of developing a super technology that might turn the tide of war.

From the west arrives hordes of Asian foes; from the south arrives a union of South American countries through Mexico, and from the east lands come legions of Soviets who have taken over all of Europe. America besieged has to rely on the remaining ground and air forces left in the country along with partisan uprisings to defend mom's apple pie. Up to four players can play Fortress America, one player being the U.S. and up to three others controlling the invading units from a particular direction. Being a near future scenario, the units in the game include conventional infantry, APCs, hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, US partisan units, and special Star Wars laser relay systems that fire from space. The game emphasizes combined arms in that players receive a bonus if infantry, mechanized, and air power are all used in a conflict. For the invading countries, all the units they receive for the game are given at the start so they must manage them wisely. The U.S., however, starts with a skeleton defense and builds up throughout the game through a random deck of cards. Further, the U.S. slowly builds up its Star Wars system, so the longer the invaders are delayed, the more powerful the U.S. becomes both conventionally and through its defense system.

To start play, each player has 1 banknote (a random facedown card) in their safe and a hand of six cards; seven types of jewelry are included in the game. On a turn, each player in clockwise order from the round's starting player places 06 cards from their hand into their store window. (If a player's window is empty, they must place at least one card.) Next, in clockwise order players can place one card face up in their safe or pass; when a player passes, they take the lowest numbered purchase card, and players continue placing cards one by one until they pass. Starting with the player who has the lowest purchase card, players can buy all of the cards in someone's store window — including their own — by paying the owner 1 banknote, after which they place these cards in their safe. (If you have cards in your store window, you must purchase cards.) As soon as a player has four of the same type of jewelry in their safe, whether from playing cards there directly or from purchasing someone's window goods, they must cash in those cards. If you have only one type of jewelry in the safe, you flip all four cards into your safe for 4 bank notes. For each extra type of jewelry in the safe, you flip one fewer card, e.g., with three types of jewelry, you flip only 2 banknotes, discarding the other two cards from play. If a player declines to purchase cards, the purchase round ends immediately, then players refill their hand to six cards. If this isn't possible because the deck has run out, the game ends. Whoever has the most banknotes wins.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":"familygames","min_players":3,"max_players":5,"recommended_num_players":"3","suggested_play_age":10,"categories":["Card Game"],"mechanics":["Set Collection"],"playing_time":30,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":5697,"avg_rating":6.20232,"num_rates":933,"rank_subcategory_1":2032,"rank_subcategory_2":1667,"avg_weight":1.7701,"num_weights":87,"owned_by":1488,"wished_by":133,"popularity_score":0.13154342211041548,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":1,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Short","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":1,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":0,"is_small_group_game":1,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Titan","description":"This classic game of the Fantasy Monster Slugathon is a standby from the The Avalon Hill Game Co of yore. The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches. The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards. On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process. When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in. After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points. The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan. As the points increase, the Titans become ever more powerful; at game end, the titan is able to kill most other character with a single blow. But be careful: If the Titan dies, the player is out of the game. The last Titan standing is the ruler of all, and winner of the game.","subcategory_1":"wargames","subcategory_2":"thematic","min_players":2,"max_players":6,"recommended_num_players":"3","suggested_play_age":12,"categories":["Fantasy","Wargame"],"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Minimap Resolution","Player Elimination","Roll / Spin and Move","Secret Unit Deployment","Set Collection"],"playing_time":240,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":1536,"avg_rating":6.96485,"num_rates":4050,"rank_subcategory_1":354,"rank_subcategory_2":379,"avg_weight":3.4653,"num_weights":432,"owned_by":5879,"wished_by":814,"popularity_score":0.17679360027472193,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":1,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":1,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Very Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":1,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":1},{"game_name":"Extrablatt","description":"Players take on the role of editors in this older German title, choosing stories of various general types (politics, sports, entertainment, etc.) to run in their respective newspapers.

This translates to Contest of the Architects. The game has a beautiful assortment of large, thick tiles to represent the cities. Players bid on a single building tile every turn, with half the proceeds going to the auctioning player. When a player is ready to start construction of his city, the tiles are laid out in order with the single restriction that not two touching tiles are the same type. The building types are city halls, churches, towers, and gates. When the one of the two draw piles is exhausted, the cities are judged for symmetry, with the highest scoring city winning. Rules apply to either game: Within two decks of 20 cards are contained the City Wall, Towers and Gates, Churches, City Halls, etc. During play, one of the decks lies face up, the other face down. There are three parts to each player's turn. First, the player rolls a die in an attempt to better his finances (1 to 5 on the die; the sixth side gives a sabotagecounter instead). Second, he alone may look at the top hidden card before he makes an offer on either of the two top cards from the two decks. The other players then bid on the two cards. If the player (the Auctioneer) makes the highest bid, he may take the card and pay the bank. If, on the other hand, one of the other players buys the card, that player pays half the money to the bank and half to the Auctioneer. Third, a player may either build (lay down another card on his city) or sabotage a City Card of another player. The player receiving the sabotage must then pay the value of the card or remove it. The game ends when either of the decks is depleted.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":"familygames","min_players":3,"max_players":4,"recommended_num_players":"3","suggested_play_age":10,"categories":["City Building"],"mechanics":["Auction / Bidding"],"playing_time":45,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":9213,"avg_rating":6.10947,"num_rates":400,"rank_subcategory_1":2465,"rank_subcategory_2":2237,"avg_weight":1.9643,"num_weights":28,"owned_by":784,"wished_by":31,"popularity_score":0.1250090292428888,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":1,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Medium","tag_Medium":1,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":0,"is_small_group_game":1,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Auf Achse","description":"Auf Achse translates roughly to On the Road, an appropriate title for this 1987 Spiel des Jahres winner which has players delivering loads of commodities to various German and other European cities.

To do this players auction off different provinces on the board and bid on these provinces with a hand of cards representing mercenaries, seasons, scarecrows, and political figures. However, unlike standard auctions in which only the highest bidder loses their bid, in Condottiere every player loses their bid. Players are, in effect, bidding the number of troops they are willing to lose in order to win a province. However, several special effect cards shake the contests up and keep the players guessing.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":6,"recommended_num_players":"6","suggested_play_age":10,"categories":["Bluffing","Card Game","Medieval","Negotiation"],"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Auction / Bidding","Constrained Bidding","Hand Management"],"playing_time":45,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":1006,"avg_rating":6.88261,"num_rates":10435,"rank_subcategory_1":657,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":1.9593,"num_weights":738,"owned_by":13480,"wished_by":2059,"popularity_score":0.23024953508568965,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Medium","tag_Medium":1,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":1},{"game_name":"Plotters, Inc.","description":"Plotters, Inc., first released as Mit List und Tücke (With Cunning and Treachery), is a tricktaking game with quite a few twists. The deck consists of cards in four suits, and the deck is adjusted based on the player count so that everyone receives a hand of 14 cards to begin a round. At the start of a trick, the lead player plays any card, setting trump for that trick. Each other player plays any card that they like — except that once three colors of cards have been played, the fourth color cannot be played. Whoever plays the highest trump card wins the trick and collects two of the cards played (or three cards in a game with five or six players), placing these cards in front of them. Whoever plays the lowest nontrump card collects the remaining cards; this player leads to the next trick. Once a player has cards of all four colors in front of them, they must choose two colors and leave cards of this color face up, placing all other cards face down. As they collect more cards, they place them face up or face down based on their colors. The round ends after 14 tricks or when a player would be forced to play a card of the fourth color to a trick; in this latter case, the round ends immediately. Each player then scores the cards they've collected. For their two faceup colors, they multiply these numbers together; they then divide this product by the number of cards that they placed face down, rounding this number down. For example, if you have 6 yellow cards, 4 red cards, and 2 blue cards, then you have (6 • 4)/2 = 12 points. If you collect cards of only one color, then you score 0 points! Play as many rounds as the number of players. Whoever has the highest total score wins!","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":4,"max_players":6,"recommended_num_players":"3","suggested_play_age":null,"categories":["Card Game"],"mechanics":["Trick-taking"],"playing_time":60,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":6386,"avg_rating":6.76034,"num_rates":353,"rank_subcategory_1":2103,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":1.8261,"num_weights":23,"owned_by":626,"wished_by":104,"popularity_score":0.13952168971233825,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Unknown","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":1,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Medium","tag_Medium":1,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":0,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":1},{"game_name":"Ransom","description":"This game comes inside what looks like a video tape case, which is definitely odd for a board game.

Any Investor cards not dealt to the players are set aside for now. The Influence Card deck is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards face down. The player whose Investor is first in alphabetical order goes first. The player to the starting player’s right places the Dollar marker on any space on the game board. Each space on the game board represents a potential deal which Investors have to approve the deal and the number of dividends to be paid to those investors. On one’s turn, a player can open negotiations on the deal where the Dollar marker rests or roll the sixsided die. If the player rolls the die, the Dollar marker is advanced clockwise around the game board counting the available deals as spaces. Once the Dollar marker rests, the player may try to negotiate that deal or draw three Influence cards. If by drawing cards, the player’s hand exceeds twelve the player chooses which cards to discard to the limit. Should a player choose to make the deal, the player negotiates with the player or players representing the Investors how to divide the money at stake. The amount is number of dividends written on the space multiplied by value of the shares written on the deal tile. Any or all of the players may use their Influence cards to affect the outcome of the deal: • Clan cards may act in place of Investors whether the Investors are in play or not. • Travel cards put Investors out of play for the negotiations. Some are specific for a given Investor; some are wild to be played on any Investor. • Recruitment cards can only be played in sets of three to steal another player’s Investor and make it your own. • Boss cards give the player control of the negotiations. • Stop cards immediately stop the effects of Travel, Recruitment, and Boss Influence cards. The players are paid from the bank when a deal has been struck. The game board space is covered with the Deal tile (effectively closing the space from further game play), the Dollar marker is moved to the next open space, and play continues with next player. Once nine deals have been made, a die is rolled after each subsequent deal to determine whether the game ends (with the odds increasing each time).

First, each tile is 3x1 (to be played on a 19x19 board) and has exactly three outlets (potential connection points). Second, your score is not simply the number of spots you've reached on one edge added to the number of spots you've reached on the other, but is the product of those two numbers. So you can't just concentrate on one side and ignore the other, because zero times anything is still zero. Third, on each side of the board there are three special points which score double if reached, adding a dab of focus to the choices. Interestingly, you need to play both offense and defense and will often have to decide to which use to put a particular tile.","subcategory_1":"abstracts","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":4,"recommended_num_players":"4","suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["Abstract Strategy"],"mechanics":["Connections","Team-Based Game","Tile Placement"],"playing_time":45,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":2533,"avg_rating":6.94811,"num_rates":1571,"rank_subcategory_1":76,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":2.0662,"num_weights":151,"owned_by":2166,"wished_by":502,"popularity_score":0.15802911547644166,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":1,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Medium","tag_Medium":1,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Modern Art","description":"Buying and selling paintings can be a very lucrative business.

Each turn, players place tiles onto the grid board that modify (either positively or negatively) the amount of money to be made by the shops that share that tile's row or column. Three times the board is filled with tiles and shop money is earned, after which the player with the most money wins. In Kingdoms, the first Englishlanguage version of Auf Heller und Pfennig, players try to collect the most gold by establishing castles in the richest regions of the realm while avoiding hazards like dragons, swamps, and trolls. The 2011 edition includes detailed plastic castles, a streamlined rulebook, and the addition of a wizard tile — one that increases the rank of adjacent castles, multiplying their scores — previously available only at game conventions. As of 2024, Cosmolancer is the newest version of this design, with players taking the role of freelance photographers...in space! As in the other versions, the game lasts three rounds, and to start a round, each player draws a random tile and keeps it secret. On a turn, you either: • Draw a tile and place it in an empty space on the 6x5 grid. • Place the tile in your hand. • Place one of your tokens, which are numbered 14, in an empty space. When all of the spaces are filled, you score each of your tokens, multiplying the number on the token by the sum of the tiles in its row and column, with some special tiles nullifying positive values or splitting a row into two segments. You retrieve all of your 1 tokens, but the others are now out of play.

Like Cosmic Encounter, it is a game that generates player interaction through negotiation and bluffing. Players each take the role of one of the factions attempting to control Dune. Each faction has special powers that overlook certain rules in the game. Each turn players move about the map attempting to pick up valuable spice while dealing with giant sandworms, deadly storms, and other players' military forces. A delicate political balance is formed amongst the factions to prevent any one side from becoming too strong. When a challenge is made in a territory, combat takes the form of hidden bids with additional treachery cards to further the uncertainty. The game concludes when one faction (or two allied factions) is able to control a certain number of strongholds on the planet.

Each player starts with a hand of six cards from a deck that contains cards in seven currencies ranging in value from 2060, along with coins worth 10. Four cards from the deck are placed face up to its left and to its right. In a round, each player chooses a bid of one or more cards from their hand, then everyone reveals their bid simultaneously. Whoever bid the highest sum takes the four cards to the left or right of the deck or another player's bid, adds these cards to their hand, then places their bid next to the deck or in front of the player whose bid they took. (Alternatively, the player can return their bid to hand.) Then the next player with the highest bid resolves their bid similarly. Once all players have resolved their bids, draw cards from the deck to refill the lots to the left and right of the deck to four cards. When the deck runs out, play one final round, then score your cards in hand. If you have 200 or more in a single currency, score that many points.

But few games ever attempt to simulate that aspect. Players are assigned a horse and must move it around the track by rolling a single die. This would be rather boring if the game didn't allow for the players to bet on another player's horse, so the dilemma is whether or not to move your horse badly just to make it easier for the horse you bet on to win. Even that could be boring, but then each player is issued cards that allow them to commit dirty tricks, for instance making a horse fall or forcing the winner to take a drug test. All in all, it makes for some very interesting racing.","subcategory_1":"partygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":6,"recommended_num_players":"5","suggested_play_age":10,"categories":["Animals","Racing","Sports"],"mechanics":["Betting and Bluffing","Roll / Spin and Move"],"playing_time":90,"language_dependence_description":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","game_rank":6076,"avg_rating":6.27436,"num_rates":891,"rank_subcategory_1":469,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":1.6582,"num_weights":79,"owned_by":1389,"wished_by":96,"popularity_score":0.13180061419118883,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":1,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":1,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":1},{"game_name":"Princess Ryan's Star Marines","description":"The evil Dar Yamaguchi has kidnapped Princess Ryan and now a third rate group of Star Marines is charged with finding her before she's put to death.

Take It Easy is a true multiplayer solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagonshaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles. There's no limit to number of players if you've got enough sets on hand. One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is. The 987, for example. Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he'll play the 987. This is repeated until the boards are filled. The idea is to complete samenumbered lines across your board. Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line. A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example...but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle. Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed. But that's as far as the comparison goes. Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.","subcategory_1":"abstracts","subcategory_2":"familygames","min_players":1,"max_players":8,"recommended_num_players":"1","suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Puzzle"],"mechanics":["Bingo","Pattern Building","Tile Placement"],"playing_time":20,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":2319,"avg_rating":6.60693,"num_rates":3333,"rank_subcategory_1":113,"rank_subcategory_2":764,"avg_weight":1.4892,"num_weights":231,"owned_by":4842,"wished_by":343,"popularity_score":0.15470077567305912,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":1,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":1,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Short","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":1,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":1,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":1},{"game_name":"Iron Dragon","description":"Description from the publisher: Iron Dragon takes railroading games where they have never gone before — to a land filled with elves, catpeople, trolls and magic. Genetically engineered dragons pull trains across dangerous and unexplored territory. Connect cities, fight off forest creatures, and explore the underground to build a railroad empire. Based on the Empire Builder system, this fantasy game puts classic building strategy and money management tools in a new venue. Players use erasable crayons on a special board and operate a rail empire. Perfect for an evening of fun and adventure with family and friends. In Iron Dragon, probably the most elaborate of the crayon rail games from Mayfair Games, players are set within a fantasy world attempting to create an extensive and profitable rail network. Players use crayons to draw their rail lines on the game board itself and use their existing rail lines to pick up and deliver commodities for payouts dictated by cards. In addition to the standard mechanisms of Empire Builder, Iron Dragon introduces Foremen, which reduce terrain building/river crossing costs depending on their race (elves get a discount in the forest, dwarves get a discount in the mountains, etc.) and Ships, which allow trains to cross the sea between continents, avoid bottlenecks on land, or jump between two unconnected rail networks. Resources are much more segregated by region, with each region specializing in a few resources based on their back story (which is written in the manual).","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":6,"recommended_num_players":"2","suggested_play_age":14,"categories":["Fantasy","Trains","Transportation"],"mechanics":["Crayon Rail System","Hexagon Grid","Multiple Maps","Network and Route Building","Pick-up and Deliver"],"playing_time":240,"language_dependence_description":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","game_rank":2454,"avg_rating":7.01187,"num_rates":1682,"rank_subcategory_1":1192,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":2.9267,"num_weights":150,"owned_by":2645,"wished_by":264,"popularity_score":0.1542998788682785,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Teen","tag_Teen":1,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Very Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":1,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":1},{"game_name":"Caesar & Cleopatra","description":"Caesar and Cleopatra is a two player card laying game where players assume the roles of these two great leaders.

They can send fewer agents facedown or more agents faceup. Additionally they can play action cards like Assassins that take out opposing agents or scouts that reveal facedown agents. Players can decide if they want to refill their hand from the agent deck or the action card deck but once one of the decks is empty they don't have access to any more of these cards. After each players turn, a card from the voting stack is revealed and the group of officials that is indicated on the card casts their vote. The player who has the most influence points next to that group wins one official from that group to his cause and then removes his strongest agent from that stack. The game ends when all the officials have picked a side and the player who has influenced most of them wins the game, with bonus points for the majority in each group and some simple hidden objectives.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":2,"recommended_num_players":"2","suggested_play_age":10,"categories":["Ancient","Bluffing","Card Game"],"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Hand Management","Set Collection"],"playing_time":60,"language_dependence_description":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","game_rank":2551,"avg_rating":6.39531,"num_rates":4659,"rank_subcategory_1":1324,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":1.9115,"num_weights":418,"owned_by":8147,"wished_by":337,"popularity_score":0.15834053453783792,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Medium","tag_Medium":1,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Frischfleisch","description":"Each player in Frischfleish (Fresh Flesh) represents a unique group of individuals stranded on a desert island.

The first edition in 1903 had a deck of 63 cards, 9 each of 7 commodities, each with a value (ranging from 40 for Flax to 100 for Wheat). Players offer trades by crying out the number of cards they want to swap (“One! One! One!”, or “Three! Three! Three!”) but not their identity. The winner of the hand is the first to collect all of one commodity, declaring “Corner on Wheat!” or whatever commodity has been collected. The winner of the hand scores points equal to the value of the commodity, and the winner of the game is the first to 500 points. The 1904 Edition of Pit added much fancier artwork and the famous Bull and Bear cards, which provide wildcard and penalty features. The early editions allowed a maximum of 7 players, but later versions supported 8 and in at least one case up to 10. Pit’s designer, noted psychic Edgar Cayce, is often accused of having stolen the idea from the game Gavitt’s Stock Exchange (GSE) invented by Harry Gavitt. While GSE claimed patents dating as early as 1896, it involved trading railway shares, and was only copyrighted and published in 1903, the same year as Pit. In addition, the only related patent assigned to Gavitt is US746492 A, filed October 7, 1903, and granted December 8, 1903. Also hitting the market in 1903 was Bourse', a remarkably similar openoutcry commodity trading game from Flinch Card Co., using an 80card deck with 10 each of 8 commodities, and Panic, using a 65 card deck with 8 each of 8 commodities and a Panic card, roughly equivalent to the Bull. Pit, however, seems to have cornered the market on openoutcry games, as neither of its competitors were seen again after 1904.","subcategory_1":"partygames","subcategory_2":"familygames","min_players":3,"max_players":8,"recommended_num_players":"5","suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["Card Game","Economic","Party Game"],"mechanics":["Commodity Speculation","Negotiation","Real-Time","Set Collection","Trading"],"playing_time":90,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":2121,"avg_rating":6.39814,"num_rates":9753,"rank_subcategory_1":200,"rank_subcategory_2":779,"avg_weight":1.1535,"num_weights":593,"owned_by":18543,"wished_by":674,"popularity_score":0.1935883672989694,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":1,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":1,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":1,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":0,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":1},{"game_name":"Andromeda","description":"Each player controls bases/stations (in the form of little wooden cubes) which they use to attempt to build Economic Centers on the moons of seven planets in an alien planetary system.

Players take actions by collecting sets of cards which correspond to the the various planets. The game also features a unique trading system which facilitates the card collecting. Careful card trading and calculating risk of establishing economic centers, and some variants, mitigate some of the luck factor. Game Summary Setup: 9 cards/player. Place 1 cube per planet per player, plus additional cube per planet matching cards dealt out; remaining cubes on earth. Each gets 2 special action cards.Each round: First, players may play a single special action card, in order. Then, Trade Step. Finally, Action Step. Trade Step: Start player first plays cards (23) to offer, one at a time; other players simultaneously show cards to trade, different than offered. Start player must trade; recipient either accepts cards into hand, or leaves out. Clockwise from Start Player, next player with cards still in front of them either makes a trade or takes their cards back. Continue till 01 people left with cards in front; they take them back to hand. Action Step: Start player takes 3 actions, then others take 2 each. Actions can be:  discard 2 cards, then draw 2  turn in set of 37 cards to send half (rounding down) as many cubes from earth to a planet  turn in set of 37 cards to advance Ship Level, Tech Level, or to make attempt to establish colony on a planet matching cards played: place cubes on that planet into the cosmic ashtray, randomize, then reveal up to as many cubes as attempts made. If reveal your cube, place it on a station; turn over. If other player's cube, send it back to earth.  Sets: if no wilds (pure), take appropriate bonus wild card matching the size of the set (if available); wilds can be used later as parts of sets Then rotate starting player to the left. Game ends when all stations on 3 planets have been taken. Score VP shown on board (for Tech level, stations occupied, and cubes on earth).

Technology is the most volatile, oil is the least volatile but with higher dividends, and retail falls in the middle. The original version of this game, Palmyra, was based around three trade routes which were represented by wooden amphoras. Note to reviewer: There is no difference, except for colour, between the 3 different commodities in the original 1996 Palmyra. Because the 3 stocks are very different in game play in the newer Buy Low Sell High game, the newer game should have a separate listing from Palmyra.

The goal of the game is to generate a set amount of money once you've linked all the major cities.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":6,"recommended_num_players":"2","suggested_play_age":10,"categories":["Economic","Trains","Transportation"],"mechanics":["Connections","Crayon Rail System","Hexagon Grid","Network and Route Building","Pick-up and Deliver"],"playing_time":240,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":2140,"avg_rating":7.10044,"num_rates":1852,"rank_subcategory_1":1088,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":2.7432,"num_weights":148,"owned_by":2784,"wished_by":177,"popularity_score":0.15437097585300036,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Very Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":1,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":1},{"game_name":"The Awful Green Things From Outer Space","description":"This humorous, entertaining game pits two players against each other aboard a spaceship.

Celebrate one of our most vital and enduring passions: railroads. Use your initial investment to build track. Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand. Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire. Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire! The original and flagship of Mayfair's crayonrails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America. Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns. For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train. The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff. Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income. Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase. During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards. When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one. Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards. When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed. During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train. A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":6,"recommended_num_players":"2","suggested_play_age":10,"categories":["Economic","Trains","Transportation"],"mechanics":["Connections","Crayon Rail System","Hexagon Grid","Movement Points","Network and Route Building","Pick-up and Deliver"],"playing_time":180,"language_dependence_description":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","game_rank":1753,"avg_rating":6.96603,"num_rates":3048,"rank_subcategory_1":993,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":2.6318,"num_weights":296,"owned_by":4538,"wished_by":383,"popularity_score":0.16191517253214238,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Very Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":1,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":1},{"game_name":"En Garde","description":"Experience the thrill of fencing— board game style!

Every player controls a 'family' and plays various cards to off other players' family members. In a game with this little structure, it's possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread. Either way, the last family standing is victorious. Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty. Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left. In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her. Lots of interaction as players play cards to put gangsters on the list, save them, have them replaced, start a Mob War, or stop it...","subcategory_1":"thematic","subcategory_2":"familygames","min_players":2,"max_players":6,"recommended_num_players":"4","suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["Card Game","Mafia"],"mechanics":["Hand Management","Player Elimination","Take That"],"playing_time":30,"language_dependence_description":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","game_rank":4124,"avg_rating":6.07181,"num_rates":4293,"rank_subcategory_1":965,"rank_subcategory_2":1505,"avg_weight":1.3187,"num_weights":386,"owned_by":6704,"wished_by":294,"popularity_score":0.14759537175538393,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":1,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":1,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Short","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":1,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":1},{"game_name":"Chess","description":"Chess is a twoplayer, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate (when the king cannot escape from the opponent's pieces), resignation (when one player recognizes he cannot win the game and ends it), or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typically featuring games and commentary by chess masters. The game has its origins in the Indian game Chaturanga, and became Shatranj when introduced to the Persians. The current form of the game emerged in the second half of the 15th century when the Persians brought Shatranj to Southern Europe. The tradition of organized competitive chess began in the 16th century. The first official World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886. Chess is also a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee.","subcategory_1":"abstracts","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":2,"recommended_num_players":"1","suggested_play_age":6,"categories":["Abstract Strategy"],"mechanics":["Grid Movement","Once-Per-Game Abilities","Pattern Movement","Square Grid","Static Capture","Sudden Death Ending"],"playing_time":0,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":445,"avg_rating":7.22203,"num_rates":38003,"rank_subcategory_1":46,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":3.654,"num_weights":2893,"owned_by":56297,"wished_by":443,"popularity_score":0.3155955587898699,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":1,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Short","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":1,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"For Sale","description":"For Sale is a quick, fun game nominally about buying and selling real estate.

The gardener must try to block the mole's moves and fence him in quickly, while the mole must dig as many holes as possible before being caught. Essentially, the mole may move any direction, horizontally or diagonally from square to square, while the gardener places boundary sticks down along the edges of the square, which the mole may not cross. The mole and gardener may either move or place down a boundary stick, and move alternately. Eventually, the gardener will hem the mole in completely and the round is over. In addition, if the mole can move into flower beds, extra points are scored. By moving to the center, the mole may also tunnel deeply to any selected square on the board, thus escaping the (by then) rapidly closing trap of boundary sticks. Depending on how many moves this took, more or less points are earned by the mole. Once points are totaled up, the roles are reversed and another round is played. The winner is the player who scored the most points as the mole.","subcategory_1":"abstracts","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":2,"recommended_num_players":null,"suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["Abstract Strategy"],"mechanics":["Enclosure","Variable Player Powers"],"playing_time":15,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":13173,"avg_rating":5.98991,"num_rates":218,"rank_subcategory_1":606,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":1.7188,"num_weights":32,"owned_by":375,"wished_by":56,"popularity_score":0.12223281505399072,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":1,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Short","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":1,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Nuba","description":"The board is a 5 x 6 grid.

However the maniacal Devil Bunny is hopping about in a mad lust for blood thinking he'll get a ham by knocking you off. Yeah, right, whatever. The game board is a rectangular grid representing the side of a building, with the starting space at the bottom, and the goal at the top. There is a dotted line near the top that represents a critical height (see below). Furthermore, there are special spaces on the sides of the buildings that represent fear that cannot be moved into (As a show of Cheapass Games' signature humor, these fears included spiders and Wesley Snipes.) In the basic game, each player controls two souschefs; on each turn, the player rolls two sixsided dice. Any roll other than a 6 can be used to move one or both souschefs up the side of the building, either horizontally or on upwards diagonals (a player cannot voluntarily move down the building). If a 6 is rolled, the Devil Bunny token is moved to the highest souschef on the board and knocks him off; if there is a souschef vertically below the one that was knocked off, the player controlling that one may opt to catch the falling souschef, placing the token in the spaces immediately below him. If no player that is able to catch the sous chef offers to help, the chef will crash to the ground. If the chef fell from a height below the marked line on the board, the chef is safe but must restart him climb back from the start. However, if the chef was above this line, the chef is dead, leaving the player with one fewer token to win. The players earn points for the order in which their chefs arrive at the top, and the weighting is such that a player with second and thirdplace chefs can beat a player with a firstplace and a dead (nonscoring) chef. Variants include ignoring the effects of the fear spaces (which normally cluster the players into the center columns), and using 3 souschef tokens for each player. In 2022, Greater Than Games created a boxed edition with upgraded components.","subcategory_1":"familygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":5,"recommended_num_players":"3","suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["Abstract Strategy","Dice","Print & Play"],"mechanics":["Grid Movement","Race","Roll / Spin and Move","Take That"],"playing_time":30,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":27046,"avg_rating":5.39906,"num_rates":722,"rank_subcategory_1":3241,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":1.1757,"num_weights":74,"owned_by":1352,"wished_by":36,"popularity_score":0.11244865016010654,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":1,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Short","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":1,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Split","description":"Newer version of SPLIT is now available.

Instead the board features a split map, half of which has the goodsproducing hexes of a conventional Settlers game where settlements will be built and the other half showing a closeup of Nürnberg where workshops will be built (in lieu of promoting settlements to cities as in the original Settlers). The players also get currency for manufactured goods which in turn they spend on walls and towers to surround the city, which earn prestige points which ultimately count toward victory points. Probably the most interesting other detail is that instead of rolling dice, a special deck of cards is used to reveal the production number  and possibly an event  at the beginning of each player's turn.

With politicians like Eduard Boremtodev, Nikolai Shootemdedsky and Natasha Nogoodnik vying for control of the party, you know the battle will be an entertaining one. At the start of the game, a number of politician cards are laid out to fill the positions of the politburo. Players then secretly note influence on ten politicians they hope to control during the game, indicated by a number from 1 to 10. Gameplay is not clockwise, but proceeds phase by phase with the politician holding the relevant office performing the appropriate action by the player who reveals the greatest influence on the politician in question. Players attempt to remove politicians opposed to their interests by purging, exiling them to Siberia or by demoting them within the Politburo. One’s own preferred politicians can be promoted or pardoned of their previous ‘sins’. But each action a politician takes causes him (or in one case, her) to age by one or more years (a measure of the aging effect of the stress of the job). Each turn, politburo members face a health check which can result in the politician becoming ill, or even dying. The 'older' a politician gets the more likely it is that he (or she) will become ill. At the end of each turn, the Party Chief must be healthy enough to wave to the crowd at the October parade. Controlling a politician who succeeds at this three times makes you the winner. The original Fata Morgana edition included rules requiring the players to hold funeral speeches for deceased party chairmen and drinking vodka with it, for instance. The later Avalon Hill edition scrapped these rules and gave the game a less satirical and more serious tone. Jolly Roger reimplemented an edition providing three different KREMLIN games in one box See Kremlin (Third Edition): 1: The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia. This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules. 2: A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'. Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians. It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game 3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution. This version introduces the concept of Going into Exile to avoid Siberia. It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.","subcategory_1":"thematic","subcategory_2":"strategygames","min_players":3,"max_players":6,"recommended_num_players":"4","suggested_play_age":12,"categories":["Negotiation","Political"],"mechanics":["Voting"],"playing_time":75,"language_dependence_description":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","game_rank":1692,"avg_rating":6.96721,"num_rates":2979,"rank_subcategory_1":393,"rank_subcategory_2":934,"avg_weight":2.8493,"num_weights":272,"owned_by":4214,"wished_by":542,"popularity_score":0.1652825478292225,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":1,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":1,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":0,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":1},{"game_name":"HellRail: Second Perdition","description":"Based on Dante's Inferno, HellRail: 2nd Perdition has players creating rail to deliver the souls of the damned to the appropriate circles of Hell.

The battle between farmers and ranchers is fairly abstract. A single pawn travels on a square grid. Each player has a hand of cards face up. These each have a direction and a distance. The player can either draw a card and add it to his hand, or play a card. If he plays a card, then the pawn moves the appropriate distance to an empty square, and the player places one of his markers. Each player also has judge symbols that can each be used only once. The judge lets you move onto a previously placed opposition marker and reverse it. Players score points for each contiguous region equal to the square of the number of markers. If a player is not careful, such a move may be forced, as there is a maximum number of cards that a player may hold. Contains rules for playing with 4 (in two partnerships of two players). Later republished 1999 as Rosenkönig by Kosmos, as part of the twoplayer game series. The republication also included a retheming of the game. The setting changed from Texas to England, and the factions changed from farmers and ranchers to the factions of the Plantagenet family from the Wars of the Roses (14551485)  the Lancaster (red rose) and the York (white rose) factions in a similarly abstracted fashion.

These provide varying economic and strategic value, from 05, and with a salt mine in the center, random distribution (with a little tinkering) makes a varied map each game. Players have a village tile which they place on the outer edge, and start with some camels and money. Your turn simply consists of moving and buying camels, expanding your control of the land. Targui has very simple mechanisms, and is in effect a simple rolling war game with obvious tactics. But the random turn order creates a wonderful world of rapidly shifting alliances, with players making and breaking promises within moments. The winner is not the one with most money or camels, but with the most economic value under their control. The game plays nicely with 3 or 4 players. However, Targui is a long game. Eight rounds takes about three hours, so using the whole deck of 20 fortune cards makes for an overlong game. If you enjoy Risk or light wargaming, then you'll get a lot from Targui.","subcategory_1":"wargames","subcategory_2":"strategygames","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"recommended_num_players":"3","suggested_play_age":12,"categories":["Arabian","Wargame"],"mechanics":["Modular Board","Player Elimination","Tile Placement","Variable Set-up"],"playing_time":120,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":5527,"avg_rating":6.40714,"num_rates":780,"rank_subcategory_1":1511,"rank_subcategory_2":2042,"avg_weight":2.3871,"num_weights":62,"owned_by":1772,"wished_by":58,"popularity_score":0.134022411833468,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":1,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":1,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Skworms","description":"The Worms Crawl In, The Worms Crawl Up Game The object of the game is to be the first to get all your worms up the skeleton's bones so they disappear into his skull.

The deck consists of 108 cards (102 number cards and 6 pepper cards), with cards being numbered 118 in six colors and with the 1s being peppers. Based on the player count, you use 46 colors of cards ranging from 19 to 118. At the start of each round, you receive 12 cards in hand, and you must place any peppers on the table in front of you. The lead player in a trick plays any card from their hand or one of their peppers. Each other player must follow suit, if possible, except that you are not forced to play the matching pepper card, should you have it. (However, if you do have it, you cannot play a pepper of another color to this trick.) Whoever plays the highest card in the suit led wins the trick and leads the next trick. If you win a pepper in a trick, place it on the table in front of you; you can play this pepper on a future trick, whether to lead off the trick or to play it on a trick that's already in progress. As soon as a player has no cards in hand, the round ends. All players add any cards in hand to the cards in front of them, whether peppers or cards claimed in tricks. Each pepper you have is worth 2 points, and each card in the same suit as a pepper you have is worth 1 point.

Each player places a color card down as their marker and the matching sets of cards numbered 112 in those colors make up the deck. The deck is shuffled and players get 4 cards, the remainder goes down as a draw deck. There is a set of small tiles in red and black for negative or positive points (red are 4,4,5,5,6,6, black are 2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6). These are shuffled face down and 4 turned up to start 4 rows. On your turn, you can place a card against a row or try to swap a card with another player. If you want to swap, you simply offer a color for another color, mentioning no numbers. Swap with the player of your choice, but if nobody wants to swap, you've wasted your turn. When you play a card to a row, you draw back so you have 4 cards. When the row is full, determined by the number on the tile, the player with the highest total in the cards has to take the tile, be it positive or negative. Usually your choices are obvious, but sometimes it is worth assisting another player to take a row, rather than waste a good card for you on a low or negative tile. If a row is tied between players, the cards are discarded and the tile stays for more cards. The discard deck is shuffled over, taken tiles refreshed by new ones. The game ends when the tiles are all taken, deduct the negative from the positive to get your score.

It is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process. The deck is a standard 52card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination — single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. — or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, they win the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc. The last player out in a round gives all the cards they won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, tens and Kings are worth 5, 10 and 10 points, with each hand worth one hundred points without bonuses — but the bonuses are what drive the game. At the start of a round, each player can call Tichu prior to playing any card. This indicates that the player thinks they can empty their hand first this round; if they do so, their team scores 100 points, and if not, their team instead loses 100 points. Cards are dealt at the start of a round in a group of eight and a group of six; a player can call Grand Tichu after looking at only their first eight cards for a ±200 point bonus. If both players on a team exit a round prior to either player on the opposite team, then no points are scored for cards and the winning team earns 200 points (with Tichu/Grand Tichu bonuses and penalties being applied as normal). The first team to 1,000 points wins.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":4,"max_players":4,"recommended_num_players":"4","suggested_play_age":12,"categories":["Card Game"],"mechanics":["Hand Management","Ladder Climbing","Predictive Bid","Team-Based Game"],"playing_time":60,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":239,"avg_rating":7.57548,"num_rates":16041,"rank_subcategory_1":173,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":2.3388,"num_weights":971,"owned_by":25882,"wished_by":2318,"popularity_score":0.2817466074678695,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Medium","tag_Medium":1,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":0,"is_small_group_game":1,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Atlanteon","description":"The original edition, titled Revolution, is set in French Revolutionera Paris.

Heating your hotplate is a random affair with a die, and could raise the heat on everyone's plate. Spicing the dish is heart of the game and done by upending small bottles filled with little colored wood pellets.

Individual pieces of a set are worthless at game's end, but are able to be sold during the course of the game in order to provide a cashflow. These 'properties' are represented on cards. There are 12 different types of properties, varying from 3  6 pieces per set. Naturally, the sets containing six pieces are much more valuable than the sets containing only three pieces as it is much more difficult to complete these larger sets. Each player is dealt six cards and given a starting 'fund' of $2,000. The top 'property' card is revealed and a bidding ensues. The winner pays the bank and takes the card into his hand. The player then has the option of selling 1  3 properties to the bank. The idea here is to rid yourself of properties that you do not wish to collect and provide a source of income. There is danger, however. The sales price is determined randomly via the roll of two dice. The price can vary from 25%  100% of the listed worth of the item. Further, if a '0' is rolled on one of the dice, then the item is NOT sold outright, but rather an auction takes place amongst the players. This can result in a substantially reduced price to the seller, or a higher price, depending upon the demand for the item. Further, it is quite possible that no one desires the item, so the seller must take the item back into his hand. There is also the possibility that the player will earn a $200 bonus if the proper digit is rolled on one of the dice. When a property is sold, it is placed on the appropriate section of the 'board'  25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% (there really isn't a board, just a card holder that indicates these sections). After a player sells properties, he may surrender one of the special 'buyer' cards and purchase from 1  3 cards from one of these markets. The player must pay the indicated price (based on the particular percentage market where the property is located) and take the property into his hand. Again, there is a decision to be made here. Buyer cards are very valuable, as they can be used in a number of fashions: 1) Purchase properties, as described above; 2) Used as a 'wild' card to complete a set; or 3) Valued as $500.00 at the end of the game. So, a player has to weigh the advantages of each of these options and play accordingly. Buyer cards are purchases at auction in conjunction with a property card. When a Buyer card is revealed, another card is then revealed, and both cards are then auctioned together. The auction is a 'sealed' auction, however, so the stakes are often high as these cards carry tremendous advantages. The game continues in this fashion until the property deck expires or a player calls an end to the game. One can only do this, however, if he has a total value (property sets plus cash) in excess of $5,000. Even then, a player should only do this when he feels he has more assets than any of his opponents. As High Bid, this game was published for the 3M Bookshelf Series and 3M Gamette Series.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":"familygames","min_players":2,"max_players":4,"recommended_num_players":"3","suggested_play_age":12,"categories":["Negotiation"],"mechanics":["Auction / Bidding","Set Collection"],"playing_time":25,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":13367,"avg_rating":5.89597,"num_rates":290,"rank_subcategory_1":2779,"rank_subcategory_2":2608,"avg_weight":1.7941,"num_weights":34,"owned_by":1288,"wished_by":37,"popularity_score":0.12164502305211869,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":1,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Short","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":1,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Volle Hütte","description":"Players take on the role of clubowners vying for customers' Deutsch Marks in this unique board game, called Full House in German. Each player is given a small board representing their cafe or pub. In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal)  activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM. When there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 14 customers to move, depending on the tiles. This is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them billdodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game. So if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money (Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours (This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits. And if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 3070 DM).

It was later rereleased by HAH under the name Ikusa. The game focuses on the chaotic feudal society of Japan during the Middle Ages. Players play one of several factions that erupt into a civil war, trying to consolidate their strongholds and then defeat other armies for the right to be called Shogun, the supreme ruler. In the game, players command forces on islands of feudal Japan. Player forces include provincial forces in the provinces and mobile armies commanded by daimyos. In each turn, players will allocate their koku into bids and purchases for the round. The round begins with the allocation of turn order, which is determined by bid, and in the case of tied bids, by player agreement or random draw. Then players other bids and payments are accounted for in purchases of castles and fortresses, drafting of new troops and ronin, and a bid for the lone ninja. Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls. A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces. The game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell's Shogun. Ikusa is the latest iteration of the game.

If you compile a collection that contains a number of beans equal to the number value on one of beans in the collection, you may redeem the collection for the same amount of points on that card.

The game is played out over 7 epochs or rounds, from the ancient 3000 B.C. Sumerians to the preWW1 Germany, with every player controlling a new rising empire from history. Some empires are stronger than others (like the Romans), but the game's clever mechanisms can help balance that out. At the end of each epoch, players score points for all units of their color (from both the current and any previous empires) remaining on the board. Before the start of their turn a player may play up to two Event cards from their hand. The Events played are resolved before the player starts his Empire's actions. If the player's active Empire has navigation a ship token is placed in each sea or ocean listed (if an ocean is listed all adjacent seas to the ocean have ship markers put into them). A Reallocation Greater Event allows an Empire with Navigation to exchange Fleets in seas and oceans for Coins that can be used to buy back defeated troops (1 coin per troop). If the active Empire has a capitol it is taken and placed in the Empire's starting land with one unit of the Empire's available troops. Since each land space may only contain one troop the player begins expanding from their starting land by placing troops in any adjacent land space that they wish to occupy or conquer. To conquer a land the attacker moves one unit into the land space either from adjacent land or through a sea with a ship in it. Then dice are rolled, the attacker gets 2 dice and the defender only one, unless the attacker traveled across a strait or the defender's land has either a forest, the great wall of China, or mountains on the border of the land that the attacker came from. In this case the defender receives 2 dice as well. If the attack comes from the sea the defender gets 3 dice for defense. Highest score wins with ties killing off both the defender and attacker. In this case the attacker can merely place the next troop, if he has any left, in the nowempty land space. At any time the active Empire player may exchange an unplaced troop for a fort. On later turns, a fort gives the player a +1 to defensive rolls in that land. Also, if the defender in a fort loses or ties with an attacker only the fort is removed and the battle continues. Whenever an army conquers a land with a capitol the capitol mini is flipped reducing it to a city (if it was a city to begin with it is removed from board when conquered). After the active player's Empire is finished with it's actions check to see if it conquered to land spaces with resource symbols, if so it can build a monument. Then scoring takes place. Each area (MiddleEast, Northern Europe, Eurasia, etc...) has a tile with 3 values for the current Epoch. One value is for having a presence in the area (at least one land). Another value is for having Dominance in the area (at least 2 lands and more than any other player in area). The last value is for having Control of an area (at least 3 lands and no other player has any in area). These values vary from Epoch to Epoch and Area to Area (MiddleEast is more valuable in early Epochs and fades in later Epochs, for example). Total the scores from each area for all pieces of the player's color from all Empires controlled that remain on board. Then add 2 points for each capitol controlled, 1 point per city and one point for each monument controlled. After all areas are scored the next Empire called takes its turn. After all players have taken their turns and scored, for the first Epoch, the player with the highest score gets to take a preeminence marker and places it in front of him. These are secret bonus points (worth somewhere from 3 to 6) for the end of the game and may not be examined till then. This bonus to leader helps balance the Empiredraw mechanic and makes it valuable to score maximal points even early in the game, rather than tanking to get a better draw later. Then drawing begins for the next Epoch with the player having the lowest score drawing first on up to the person with the highest score drawing last (and likely being given a less than optimal Empire by another player). After the last player has scored for Epoch 7 and the leader has drawn a preeminence marker, all players reveal their preeminence markers and add them to their scores. The player with the highest score wins.","subcategory_1":"wargames","subcategory_2":"thematic","min_players":3,"max_players":6,"recommended_num_players":"4","suggested_play_age":8,"categories":["Civilization","Ancient","Medieval","Napoleonic","Post-Napoleonic","Renaissance","Wargame","World War I"],"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Dice Rolling","Hand Management"],"playing_time":270,"language_dependence_description":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","game_rank":1124,"avg_rating":7.11553,"num_rates":4596,"rank_subcategory_1":188,"rank_subcategory_2":264,"avg_weight":2.766,"num_weights":500,"owned_by":5826,"wished_by":577,"popularity_score":0.17451288232603596,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":1,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":1,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Kids","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":1,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Very Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":1,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":0,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":1},{"game_name":"Icehouse","description":"This is the game that introduced Icehouse Pieces.

The player who first acquires enough total value in cash and port/factory deeds wins the game.

The prices a player receives for selling their cargo is determined by the species that lives in the system, and what commodities a port offers for purchase is determined by a unique and dynamic supplyanddemand mechanism. With their money, players can replace their spaceships with better models, or build factories (which create better commodities) and spaceports (which speed up trading). They can also buy upgrades for their ships (like shields, lasers, or engines). Variations included in the rulebook allow for interplayer combat and solo play, and the exact target wealth players have to acquire in order to win is decided on before each play.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":1,"max_players":6,"recommended_num_players":"2","suggested_play_age":12,"categories":["Economic","Exploration","Science Fiction","Space Exploration","Transportation"],"mechanics":["Commodity Speculation","Dice Rolling","Movement Points","Pick-up and Deliver","Point to Point Movement","Roll / Spin and Move","Solo / Solitaire Game","Trading","Variable Set-up"],"playing_time":180,"language_dependence_description":"Some necessary text - easily memorized or small crib sheet","game_rank":1483,"avg_rating":7.13725,"num_rates":2785,"rank_subcategory_1":795,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":2.8327,"num_weights":281,"owned_by":3552,"wished_by":855,"popularity_score":0.17513403998872903,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Very Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":1,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":1,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":1},{"game_name":"Geronimo","description":"The U.S.  Indian conflicts, a tragic period of history.

The Mediterranean was a sea of great prosperity  the only route between East and West. The greatest fleets of the age battled for the most lucrative trade routes. Trade cities like Venice, Genoa, Barcelona or Istanbul grew as powerful as whole nations, establishing trade routes as far as North Africa or Middle East, bringing back Spice, Gems or Gold to the western Mediterranean. SERENISSIMA recreates this era, when the Mediterranean was at the centre of world trade. The Game Each players assume the role of one of those four citystates. Their goal is to establish their sphere of influence in the Mediterranean, and share all sorts of commodities to make their trading empire the most prosperous. In the course of a game, players must build galleys, hire crew and buy/sell commodities. The value of goods can be influenced by players having monopolies in certain commodities. Players can also take control of ports, thereby earning extra income from players using the port, as well as being able to get this port's specific commodity. In the end, the scoring is based on the number of ports each player control, but also on the fact that those ports have commodities of different kind available. Ports come in three types : small, medium, and citystates. Whereas small ports are quite easy to satisfy (they need only two commodities to be considered full), the four starting citystates are far more difficult to please, as they will need all kind of commodities available (6 additional commodities, plus the one they produce). During the course of the game, the number and type of commodities available in ports also controls the number of crew members you can hire, if you can build galleys or forts, and the price of commodities when you sell them. For example, a player won't be able to build new galleys until they have wood and iron available in one of the ports they control. Once a galley has been built, it has 5 spaces available, that can be filled by the crew or the goods. Every crew member allows movement through one space, and makes the galley more powerful. But those spaces are also needed to carry the goods that are worth money. Money that can be used to hire new crews, build new galleys, or commodities. A balance thus needs to be struck between trading commodities and taking control of ports  between a fleet of merchant galleys and a fleet of warships. The game lasts between 5 to 8 turns depending on the number of active players. Turn order is defined by bidding. The winner of the bid choose whether he will play first, second, third or last. Depending on the situation and what the player wants to do, playing first or last might be equally interesting. For example, by playing first, a player would be unable to react to other players move, but he could avoid having his galleys blockaded.","subcategory_1":"strategygames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":4,"recommended_num_players":"3","suggested_play_age":12,"categories":["Economic","Nautical","Renaissance"],"mechanics":["Area Movement","Dice Rolling","Pick-up and Deliver","Trading","Turn Order: Auction"],"playing_time":120,"language_dependence_description":"No necessary in-game text","game_rank":2206,"avg_rating":6.8516,"num_rates":2332,"rank_subcategory_1":1122,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":3.0347,"num_weights":259,"owned_by":3269,"wished_by":274,"popularity_score":0.15346533450430427,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":0,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":1,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":0,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":1,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage","description":"This game uses the very popular card system which first appeared in Avalon Hill's We the People game to detail the struggle between Carthage's Hannibal and the Roman Republic in approximately 200 BC. Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage is an asymmetrical card driven game for 2 players set in times of epic struggle between ancient Rome and Carthage. It presents a conflict between two superpowers of Antiquity from classical Clausewitzian perspective, according to which a power only reverts to military operations when there is no other way to achieve the goal: political dominance. Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage has been designed by one of the most acclaimed designers in the World, Mark Simonitch. Players use Strategy Cards for multiple purposes: moving generals, levying new troops, reinforcing existing armies, gaining political control of the provinces involved in the war, and introducing historical events. When two armies meet on the battlefield, a second set of cards, called Battle Cards, are used to determine the winner. Ultimately both players seek victory by dominating both fronts: military and political. The 20th Anniversary of the release of this classic game will see the release of a new, revised, updated, and expanded game entitled Hannibal  Hamilcar. This new edition reimplements the Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage game, and includes the Hamilcar: First Punic War expansion. See the Hannibal  Hamilcar entry for details of the 2017 revamped game.","subcategory_1":"wargames","subcategory_2":null,"min_players":2,"max_players":2,"recommended_num_players":"1","suggested_play_age":14,"categories":["Ancient","Political","Wargame"],"mechanics":["Area Majority / Influence","Campaign / Battle Card Driven","Dice Rolling","Events","Point to Point Movement","Simulation"],"playing_time":200,"language_dependence_description":"Extensive use of text - massive conversion needed to be playable","game_rank":427,"avg_rating":7.77875,"num_rates":5043,"rank_subcategory_1":23,"rank_subcategory_2":null,"avg_weight":3.4549,"num_weights":587,"owned_by":7454,"wished_by":1901,"popularity_score":0.2250492946080656,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":0,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":1,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Teen","tag_Teen":1,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":0,"playing_time_group":"Very Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":1,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":0,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Blackbeard","description":"Introduction (from the rule book): BLACKBEARD recreates The Golden Age of Piracy at the turn of the 18th century. Each player becomes one or more pirates and attempts to amass a fortune and retire before a King's Commissioner tracks him down, a Warship stumbles across him, or his own crew cuts his throat! Merchant ships plying the trade routes are the targets. Prizes range from nearworthless supplies to the fabulous Spanish and Mogul treasure ships. Luck, skill and cunning all play a part as you comb the Seven Seas (well ... at least three of them) for fame and fortune. Players should be aware that the game simulates 18th century piracy and therefore features random happenstance. Little can be planned. Players who are ready to strike when opportunity presents itself and are wily and aggressive without being rash will fare best in the long run. Players take up the roles of famous pirates navigating the major sea lanes during the golden age of piracy. Plunder and pirateering await as each player moves about on the map in a variable system through a deck of cards. Rather than the normal turn order in games, players move when their designation is drawn in a deck. When not in the role of their pirate they can take on the role of one of the English military ships hunting the sea for pirates. By making shrewd choices and having some luck the player can end the game a wealthy and retired pirate with a large fleet of ships that have been accumulated over the years.","subcategory_1":"wargames","subcategory_2":"thematic","min_players":1,"max_players":4,"recommended_num_players":"3","suggested_play_age":12,"categories":["Adventure","Age of Reason","Nautical","Pirates","Wargame"],"mechanics":["Dice Rolling","Grid Movement","Hexagon Grid","Movement Points","Simulation","Solo / Solitaire Game","Variable Player Powers"],"playing_time":240,"language_dependence_description":"Moderate in-game text - needs crib sheet or paste ups","game_rank":4140,"avg_rating":6.39183,"num_rates":1516,"rank_subcategory_1":934,"rank_subcategory_2":852,"avg_weight":3.2209,"num_weights":163,"owned_by":3147,"wished_by":284,"popularity_score":0.1430727016357356,"tag_cgs":0,"tag_thematic":1,"tag_partygames":0,"tag_wargames":1,"tag_abstracts":0,"tag_childrensgames":0,"tag_strategygames":0,"tag_familygames":0,"age_group":"Family","tag_Teen":0,"tag_Kids":0,"tag_Adult":0,"tag_Unknown":0,"tag_Family":1,"playing_time_group":"Very Long","tag_Medium":0,"tag_Very Long":1,"tag_Short":0,"tag_Long":0,"is_solo_game":1,"is_couple_game":1,"is_small_group_game":0,"is_party_game":0},{"game_name":"Wooden Ships & Iron Men","description":"Wooden Ships  Iron Men is a Tactical level Nautical boardwargame  Fighting ships in the Age of Sail !!!
