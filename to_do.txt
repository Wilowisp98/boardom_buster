IDEAS:
- i do not want to fetch all the games everyday, maybe i can save the maximum id from the current execution and fetch from there in future executions.
- check which columns might or might not be relevant:
    - might add:
        - popularity? (can create a metric from owned by, wished by and num of votes and rating)
        - tags (party game etc)
        - price
        - has expansions?
        - player interaction (could be deducted from the description)
    - might not use in the model:
        - description (at least how it looks now)
        - artists 
        - publishers (they can difer from country to country)
        - familiess
- when recommending a game based in more than 1 game:
    - maybe check similarity between all the games used as input.
    - if there are any that look similar:
        - use them together.
    - when they are not similar:
        - use them as distinct pieces
    - we could recommend a top 5 games, if for example, we got input of 3 and 2 are similar.
        - 3 would come from the 2 commons.
        - 2 would come from the one that was not in common.
