Only if you understand that, you could ask me for an exact shipping quote before ordering.   INSURANCE: You may add $1.35 for optional insurance.  (Otherwise, I'll just get Delivery Confirmation, but in the unlikely event that USPS lost or damaged the package, it would unfortunately be your loss.)","0"

"Lloyd's Rules of ACQUIRE is a 12 page booklet that has the original rules of the game of ACQUIRE and then Lloyd's changes highlighted in red. It also contains a Stock Price Extension Chart that helps player calculate payouts at times of mergers and at the end of the game. Lloyd's Rules are free shipping worldwide.There are a lot of grey areas in the many versions of Acquire rules. Many items are not addressed and assumptions have to be made. Because of this, I felt that first and foremost the grey areas needed to be defined. I also felt that there needed to be two major changes to the rules to help even out the distribution of money during game play. These two changes also helped to align the game more to corporate reality.The first rule change pertains to the purchase of stock. I call it the lame duck rule. I allow trading of stock when finances are gone. This change was designed to allow players with no money to be able to try to keep control in the companies that matter more. It also helps to relieve the lame duck status that is achieved when a player is out of money.The second rule change pertains to the disposition of stock at the time of a merger. I call it the dumb luck rule. I eliminated the 2-for-1 trades of stock. This rule is flawed since it doesnt address the issue of worth or the reality of a hostile takeover. An Imperial (Phoenix) with 41 tiles (worth $1,200 per share) could take out a Luxor (Sackson) with two tiles (worth $200 per share) and the player with Luxor (Sackson) stock could trade two for one. This means that a player can make $800 per trade along with possibly gaining majority in the surviving company. If the player who is holding majority in the surviving company does not have interest in the folding company, they can lose their majority out of the regular turn of play. My change in rule allows only the merge maker to acquire stock, as is the normal course of their turn. The vanquished stockholders are paid for their company and they can invest their earnings anywhere they want when it is their turn.Thousands of players around the world have enhanced their ACQUIRE experience with Lloyd's Rules of ACQUIRE. They offer a nice variant to the traditional 3M Company rules.","0"

"SHIPPPING AND SIZE INFO:VINTAGE ANTIQUE (54 years) ACQUIRE BOOKSHELF BOARD GAME (1968)12"" x 8.75"" x 2.5""2.1lbs (33.6oz)SHIPPING LOCATION: Round Lake Illinois 60073All my ads (will eventually) include size and weight of the game. Please add a little weight and around two inches per side to estimate shipping costs. For example: 11.5""Wide x 12""Long x 3.5""High at 2.8lbs should be estimated as 13x14x5 3lbs, allowing for padding, shipping box weight, and shipping container size. Please do not ask me to give you pricing to your location. Most shipping is roughly $20 dollars. If you are interested, you can look up your zip code and compare to my zip code, which is 60073.Shipping depends upon the size and weight of the game and your location's distance from northern Illinois, 60073. Please check for pricing at ups.com usps.com or fedex.com. I generally opt for the best price, which is almost always USPS PRIORITY. Prices usually range from $17 to $24, depending on weight and size, to the contiguous United States. Though I occasionally have some games that are cheaper because they are small (Boggle) or bigger (Imperium Galactica) or super heavy (Europa Universalis) and I charge accordingly. Rates differ for Protectorates and Islands as well as international shipping. Those carriers and their rates are higher, and take longer to get to you. If you're in a different country, please be patient...unless you wish to pay for quicker shipping, which we will happily provide. You may add optional insurance or signature but USPS Priority is very reliable and will give both of us updates on tracking info.I accept PayPal or Personal Check. There is no fee for personal check but PayPal charges 4% on all transactions including shipping fees. Board Game Geek charges 3% and we recover those fees upon sale. Thank you for reading and considering our offerings. All games are either brand new, shrink wrapped, unwrapped, or could be considered brand new save for being opened. If a game is played even once, it is listed in the sale. No food, drink, pet dander, nor tobacco is ever anywhere near any of the games. Opened games are usually bagged and may even be labeled as a courtesy. These are not store copies or well played copies. They are almost all brand new and never played or simply opened for display and photography.","0"

"Comments: To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the last 30 years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer's perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.In general, I'm mindful about the condition of my games while playing, but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts (so please assume that if an insert was originally included in the box that it is gone - if an insert is important to you, please ask about it).  Furthermore, most played games (with cards) were sleeved during play... but unless specifically and explicitly noted otherwise, any sleeves will have been removed before the game was offered for sale.Condition Notes: Smoke-free home.  No longer in shrink but unpunched/unused/unplayed.  Still in original styrofoam packaging inside the box.  Box shows some shelfwear which includes whitening on edges and corners.  Box has some discoloration (some of which might be from a price tag that was previously affixed?).Edition Notes: English.Shipping Notes:Note that this item is difficult (aka more expensive than normal) to ship because it is unusually heavy or unusually large or both.I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).Payment Notes:**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.[i]US buyers:[/i]When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.See the [i]Info from Seller[/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

"3D The Settlers of Catan + 3D Catan Seafarers expansion. Handmade!!!!!!!!For the assembly and painting of catan, months of work and effort have been required.I used no molds of cast plaster or other such element at its making. Each piece was made one by one and no hex resembles another. (trees, sheeps etc - all handmade piece by piece). I have put a great emphasis on the details, e.g. as you may see at the sea the wave draws back leaving wakes!I dont wish to get you tired with words so I have put on a lot of pictures. I believe the pictures show the gameoff well as they have been shot under the sun light and not artificial light.MORE photos: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1065234/my-new-custom-build-catan-3dComponents:34 Seas12 Sea Coasts4 Deserts2 Rivers5 Mountains5 Clay5 Grains5 Pastures5 Forests5 Harbors Tokens 2:16 Harbors Tokens 3:1pawns, cards, dice etc NOT included.","0"

"A fun board game the whole family can playBoth adults and kids (10 and above) alike can join in on the funHelps improve strategy and decision making skillsPlayers spread their civilization across a modular hex-boardDescriptionIntroduce a clever and strategic board game to those family game nights. The idea is for gamers to collect resources before their opponents do. Build roads by collecting and using resource cards to expand into other new settlements. Players and opponents should look to trade & barter when it comes to Catan. Collect development cards and be sure to pick the perfect strategy that suits you best to ultimately have your small island town grow into a flourishing city. Call yourself a seafarer by building ships and setting sail to conquer. With each dice roll and 19 hex tiles, you're one step closer to establishing your empire. Trade, build and you may be the first player to reach 10 victory points and thus win the game.All Board Games are brand new, factory sealed.

Also, have been on ebay since 1997 with 100% positive feedback.Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the last 30 years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer's perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.In general, I'm mindful about the condition of my games while playing, but I am not a rabid preservationist... I often discard advertisements and inserts (so please assume that if an insert was originally included in the box that it is gone - if an insert is important to you, please ask about it).  Furthermore, most played games (with cards) were sleeved during play... but unless specifically and explicitly noted otherwise, any sleeves will have been removed before the game was offered for sale.Condition Notes: Smoke-free home.

Must be in US dollars and you pay any fees.Non-US buyers--Please also note that the shipping charge will be outrageously high. Probably high enough that it does not make sense to purchase this item from me. I have no control over this.Insurance will also be REQUIRED (at receiver's expense) for shipments to non-US addresses.

"THIS IS FOR TOKYO HORROROffered is issue no.58 (September 1988) of TACTICS Magazine from Hobby Japan.  This magazine contains the game Citadel of Blood and a map and rules for the game Tokyo Horror, which is for use with the Arkham Horror game (Japanese version). For the game Citadel of Blood, the counters are inside the magazine, on paper, and need to be mounted.  Rules are also inside the magazine. For Tokyo Horror, the map is in the back of the book.  It is attached to the issue and will need to be detached.  On the inside is the rules (In Japanese).  The counters for the game are in the normal Arkham Horror Japanese version from Hobby Japan. Game map and magazine are in good shape with some shelf wear.This is in Japanese and I do not have a translation for it.Shipping is $11.00 in the USA. Ask for other places. You can pay with Paypal.","0"
"Offered is Arkham Horror from Hobby Japan.  This is the Japanese version of the game, and it contains no English.  The game is the same as the English version, except this one includes extra characters.  These characters can be used for the ""Tokyo Horror"" expansion (which is also being offered on Ebay).The game is unpunched and uncut, and in good shape.  Counters are unpunched, and the cards, money and character cards are uncut. The board is mounted and is in good shape.  Rules and charts are in good shape with no writing or rips, but there are a few humidity stains.  Box is good, with some shelf wear.  There is an area on the top left corner of the box where the paint has flaked off, and there is similar flaking along the edges and corners.  However, the box has no broken corners.  The box inside has some humidity stains.  The paper band is also included.Unlike the English version, this version does not include player pawns or clamps for the character cards.Rules are in Japanese, and I do not have a translation for it.  However, this plays like the English version.  I'm not sure about the new character types.Shipping is $18.00 in the USA.  Ask for other destinations.  You can pay with Paypal.","0"

"Comments: To see other items that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/market/user/Paladin82Y .With BGGs removal of the semi-automated Marketplace, sales via BGG require more interaction/communication between the participants which can make some buyers more anxious.  I will do my best to make this an easy transaction for you.  You can see my track record of success in the SELLER & SHIPPING section of each item listed in the GeekMarket.  See additional important comments in the SELLER NOTES section at the bottom of this listing.  *** The BGG site discontinued its marketplace feature in August 2022.

( might take 30 days ) option DOES exist if you want to take risk of Paypal Family & Friends payment ( & is NOT Tracked )( as with GAMES we can get away with using Royal Mail PRINTED PAPER upto 5Kg International Economy service, and it is MUCH CHEAPER to send this way,and most UNLIKELY that you will pay any extra charges.Unfortunately postage prices have gone up yet again recently ( 3rd time in 1 year) by about 16%International WORLDWIDE ECONOMY is ( currently 1Kg=15 2Kg=21.20 3Kg=27.40 4Kg=33.60 5Kg=39.80 )International EUROPEAN ECONOMY is ( currently 1Kg=14 2Kg=19.20 3Kg=24.40 4Kg=29.60 5Kg=34.80 )TRACKING COSTS EXTRA ( ASK specifying destination )Please add to the total sum 3.5% +  0.35 PayPal fee, if you are inside the UK or 6.5 % +  0.35 PayPal fee, if you are outside the UK.Or 0% to add if you use Paypal FRIENDS & FAMILY or UK to UK Bank Transfer .I point here to PayPal because most people use it, but there are other options like UK to UK bank transfer if you wantMy PayPal account is [ REDACTED ]My Banking Details are [ REDACTED }Please contact me if you are interested in buying 1 or more games ( postage at cost ).I will then give you my Paypal account details and my Bank Account details so we can proceed.I aim to price our games very fairly for condition, and aim to only sell complete games in very good condition , ( some rare exceptions will be inevitable , but I will check thoroughly and specify any problems I find and price accordingly ), if Price seems high then there is a good chance I want to leave it on our Kallax units as either a new and sealed duplicate spare, or I or some members of our games group still likes playing the game and are not quite ready to sell just yet.i don't mind doing exchanges UK to UK, of similar value items, assuming you have something we don't have or have had already and want to try.","0"

"Comments: To see other items that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/market/user/Paladin82Y .With BGGs removal of the semi-automated Marketplace, sales via BGG require more interaction/communication between the participants which can make some buyers more anxious.  I will do my best to make this an easy transaction for you.  You can see my track record of success in the SELLER & SHIPPING section of each item listed in the GeekMarket.  See additional important comments in the SELLER NOTES section at the bottom of this listing.  *** The BGG site discontinued its marketplace feature in August 2022.

I am looking at other options, but international couriers are expensive in the UK.On Paypal if you make payment as a cash gift to me, I am not charged a fee by Paypal (may differ if you're outside the UK) but you receive no protection in a dispute. If the Paypal payment is a commercial transaction, Paypal charges me near 4% of the payment so you get dispute protection. Of course, you don't know me from a hole in the ground. It's your right to protection obviously. But please consider adding a touch to the payment to help cover this fee.","0"

"Comments: To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the last 30 years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer's perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.In general, I'm mindful about the condition of my games while playing, but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts (so please assume that if an insert was originally included in the box that it is gone - if an insert is important to you, please ask about it).  Furthermore, most played games (with cards) were sleeved during play... but unless specifically and explicitly noted otherwise, any sleeves will have been removed before the game was offered for sale.Condition Notes: Smoke-free home.  Played a few times.  Box shows some shelfwear which includes whitening on edges and corners and the top/bottom have some dishing.Game components are complete and in excellent shape.Edition Notes: English.Shipping Notes:I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).Payment Notes:**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.[i]US buyers:[/i]When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.See the [i]Info from Seller[/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

"Comments: To see other titles that I have for sale (and perhaps mitigate shipping costs) enter the following into your browser: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y . Note that I am not a store but just a gamer like you (although one that lost his mind and purchased waaaay too many games over the last 30 years). I have tried to accurately describe my offerings from a gamer's perspective. If you are a collector or re-seller and need more details, just let me know.In general, I'm mindful about the condition of my games while playing, but I am not a collector... I often discard advertisements and inserts (so please assume that if an insert was originally included in the box that it is gone - if an insert is important to you, please ask about it).  Furthermore, most played games (with cards) were sleeved during play... but unless specifically and explicitly noted otherwise, any sleeves will have been removed before the game was offered for sale.Condition Notes: Smoke-free home.  Played a bunch over many years.  Overall, the game is in average shape and about what you would expect for a game with this many years under its belt.  The rules look like they have been thoroughly read and re-read.   Box shows significant wear and some minor tearing.  Box has been taped, but is still sound.  Box has some discoloration (some of which might be from a price tag that was previously affixed?).  The stickers are starting to peel off of the board - nothing a little glue couldn't fix - and the cardboard box insert is beat up a bit.  The actual game components are complete and in excellent shape.   Edition Notes: English.Shipping Notes:Note that this item is difficult (aka more expensive than normal) to ship because it is unusually heavy or unusually large or both.I am willing to meet you at one of the many local Game Nights close to Waukee, IA (see https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/1365) to make the exchange in person which would reduce your shipping cost to $0.00.  Otherwise--Yes, I will gladly combine orders to reduce your per-item shipping costs. (To see other items to add to your order see http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekmarket/user/Paladin82Y).When placing an order, please provide a contact phone number--this is ONLY in case there are shipping issues--I am NOT planning to call you. Also, please provide a direct/external (non-BGG) email address.Finally, if at all possible, please provide a business (rather than a residential) shipping address and let me know that the address you are providing is a business address (this may expedite delivery).Payment Notes:**Note that the listed offered price includes a small discount for a cash (cash, money order, Amazon Gift Card, western union) payment.  I cannot include the discount for payments made via Paypal.[i]US buyers:[/i]When placing the order, let me know if you would like to purchase the optional insurance offered by the shipping company. I cannot remember ever having any material problems, but theoretically there is some risk. If the receiver (you) does NOT request (and does NOT pay extra for) insurance (decision is totally up to you) then the receiver (you) agrees to assume responsibility for lost or damaged packages. I know that this paragraph sounds scary, but my lawyer makes me include this -- again, this is probably a non-issue -- I have never had a package that I shipped go missing and think that I have had two people mention extremely minor blemishes incurred during shipping in the last 600 BGG items that I have shipped.See the [i]Info from Seller[/i] Section below for more critically important details on payment options.

"Very good conditionThe Lord of the Rings is a co-operative game in which the object is to destroy the Ring while surviving the corrupting influence of Sauron. Each player plays one of the Hobbits in the fellowship, each of which has a unique power.Over the course of the game, you make your way across four conflict game boards, representing some of the most memorable conflicts from the entire trilogy: Moria, Helm's Deep, Shelob's Lair, and Mordor. Each conflict board tests your small Fellowship to the utmost as you must play your quest cards to advance along multiple tracks. These tracks represent fighting, hiding, traveling, and friendship, and by playing quest cards from your hand with matching symbols, you can keep moving forward and push closer to victory.The master game board indicates both the physical progress of the fellowship across Middle Earth and the corrupting influence of Sauron on the hobbits. If you're able to slip past your foes, you can hope to escape with minimal corruption, healing your hurts at safe havens along your path, such as the forest kingdom of Lothlrien. By playing your cards right and advancing quickly, you can collect powerful runes, unlock legendary cards to aid your journey, or find life tokens to help stave off corruption  not to mention advancing quickly through the conflicts. As you travel, the One Ring can be a crucial tool in your journey, allowing you to hide from sight, but repeated use will draw the attention of Sauron and corrupt the heart of the Ring-bearer.Your journey leads you deeper into the darkness with each passing conflict, and safe havens become few and far between. You must carefully watch the corruption track because if the Sauron miniature ever meets a Hobbit, that player is eliminated  and if the Ring-bearer is eliminated, all players lose as Sauron reclaims the power of the One Ring. To win, throw the One Ring into the volcanic fires of Mount Doom.","0"

Lead times and delivery costsOur products are delivered directly from our Berlin base, and orders are usually dispatched within two working days.

Below that amount, we charge a one-off fee of 5 euros.Our products can also be ordered for delivery outside Germany. In that case, an estimate of the delivery costs is added to your order during checkout. Please note that this delivery cost estimate does not necessarily constitute the final amount. We shall contact you personally by email after you have placed your order to present you with delivery options and to quote the final price for delivery costs.4. Payment optionsWe currently offer the following three payment options: direct debit from your bank account (only within Germany), bank transfer (prepayment) and PayPal.

Should you have already paid for your order, we shall refund those costs to you as soon as we have received your cancellation notification.Please ensure that any products returned are in good condition. If you check the products in a manner that you will have done, for example, in a shop, this is fine.

"This is true for all of my posts... these games are more like collectables to me than games that were played much at all... if at all. I will not take photos of any part or of the pieces but I can say that a good number of the games I have also have expansion packs inside the boxes with them (some even have 3, 4, or 5 expansions in the box with the standard game). I am not going to take the time to look in all of the boxes and identify the expansions so you can consider that a bonus gift when you get the game!","0"
